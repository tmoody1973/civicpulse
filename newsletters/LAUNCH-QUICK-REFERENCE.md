## Common Objections & Responses

**Q: "Why should I use this instead of Congress.gov?"**
A: Congress.gov is designed for legal researchers. Civic Pulse is designed for busy people. We make search understandable, tracking effortless, and bills readable in 2 minutes instead of 40 pages.

**Q: "Is this just a podcast platform?"**
A: No. We're a civic engagement hub. Search and tracking are primary. Podcasts are optional if you prefer audio.

**Q: "How is this different from [competitor]?"**
A: We built this during a hackathon on the Raindrop Platform. Real-time data from Congress.gov. Grounded in Congressional Record speeches, not summaries. Natural podcast audio with professional hosts.

**Q: "What about misinformation?"**
A: All our data comes from official sources: Congress.gov (bills), Congressional Record (floor speeches), The Hill (news). AI summaries cite specific bill language. Primary source transparency built in.

**Q: "Is this free forever?"**
A: Free beta for 30 days. Post-launch pricing TBD, but core civic engagement features will always be free.
