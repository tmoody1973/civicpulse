**Hi there,**

I'm building something I wish existed three years ago: **Civic Pulse**, a way to understand what Congress is doing without spending four hours reading dense legal documents.

Here's the problem I kept running into:

A bill passes the House. You hear about it on the news. You want to understand what it actually doesâ€”would it help your community? Hurt your wallet? Support something you believe in?

So you pull up Congress.gov. Find the bill. And face 40+ pages of legal text like this:

"An Act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax incentives for investments in qualified opportunity zones, and for other purposes..."

Your eyes glaze over. You give up. Congress wins, you lose.

And you're not alone. Most Americans feel disconnected from their governmentâ€”not because they don't care, but because the system isn't built for regular people. It's built for lawyers and lobbyists.

**That's what I'm fixing.**

### **Here's What Civic Pulse Does:**

**1. Turns Bills Into Conversations**

Instead of reading 40 pages, listen to a 7-minute podcast where two experts (AI-powered hosts Sarah and James) have a natural conversation about the bill:

- What does it do?
- Who does it help or hurt?
- Is there bipartisan support, or is this a partisan fight?
- Why should you care about this in YOUR state?

All in the time it takes to commute to work or make breakfast.

**2. Finds Bills That Matter to You**

You don't need to read the bill number. Just ask in plain English:

- "Show me bills about student loans"
- "What's Congress doing about healthcare costs?"
- "Find me education bills from my district"

Our AI search understands what you're actually looking for, not just keyword matching.

**3. Tracks Legislation You Care About**

Pick bills that matter. Get alerted when they move forward. Know exactly when and how your representatives vote on issues you care about.

It's like having a personal civic advisor keeping you in the loop.

### **Why I'm Building This**

I'm a developer, not a civics teacher. But I believe something fundamental: **Democracy only works when citizens understand what their government is doing.**

The current system creates a knowledge gap. Congress operates in plain sightâ€”everything is public, searchable on Congress.govâ€”but the *format* is designed for specialists, not humans.

We're not missing information. We're missing *access* to information.

Technology should fix that. Not by dumbing things down, but by translating complexity into something human-sized.

That's Civic Pulse.

---

### **Where We Are Right Now**

We're in the final stages before launch. I've loaded all 5,858 bills from the current Congress into our system. The search is working. The podcast generation is ready to go.

What's next: **beta testing with the first 100 users like you.**

If you want to be part of thisâ€”to try the platform, give feedback, help shape what civic engagement looks like in 2025â€”that's what I need from you.

### **The Vision**

Imagine three months from now:

- You wake up. Your phone has a notification: "3 new bills match your interests."
- You tap play. A 7-minute podcast briefing plays while you shower.
- You now understand three bills that could affect your life, your community, your future.
- You know exactly how your representatives voted on them.
- You can easily contact your representative if you disagree.

No legal degree required. No four-hour research session. Just informed citizenship, accessible to everyone.

That's the world Civic Pulse is building.
