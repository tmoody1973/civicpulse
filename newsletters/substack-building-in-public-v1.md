Hi friends,

I'm building something that probably shouldn't be this hard to build: a platform that makes understanding Congress as easy as checking your news feed.

And here's the thing that makes this even more challenging: **I'm not even a developer.**

I don't have a computer science degree. I didn't spend years learning to code. Three weeks ago, I had no idea what "semantic search" or "SmartSQL" meant. But I care deeply about making democracy accessible, and I realized that modern tools have changed everything. AI isn't just writing code for people—it's teaching them to build.

**Enter Claude Code: My Co-Builder and Teacher**

Think of Claude Code as a senior developer who pair programs with you, except instead of getting frustrated when you ask basic questions, it explains concepts in plain English, writes the code, and helps you understand *why* it works.

When I tell Claude Code "I need semantic search for bills," it doesn't just dump code at me. It explains: "Semantic search understands concepts, not just keywords. Here's how embeddings work. Here's why we're using SmartBuckets. Now here's the code that implements it." And then we build it together.

This isn't "AI wrote my app and I don't understand it." It's "AI is teaching me to build, and I'm learning deeply as I go." I'm making the product decisions, asking the questions, debugging the problems—but Claude Code is showing me how to think through technical tradeoffs, write better code, and understand what I'm building.

So I'm not just building an app. I'm learning product development, software architecture, and technical problem-solving—all under a hackathon deadline.

Here's the thing that's been bothering me: when you hear about a bill on the news—something about healthcare or climate or education—and you want to know what it actually says, track its progress, see how your representative voted, you're stuck navigating multiple confusing government websites with no context.

**This is ridiculous.** We have apps that track our coffee orders, but we can't easily track what our own government is doing?

So I'm building Civic Pulse to fix that—a comprehensive platform that brings together search, tracking, AI insights, representative information, and news all in one place. And because I believe in learning in public, I'm sharing the journey—the progress, the mistakes, what's working, what's not. Including the fact that I'm learning to build software *while* building this under a hackathon deadline.

### Why I'm Building This

I care about democracy. I know that sounds like something people say, but I mean it in a practical sense: democracy works better when people know what's happening. And right now, most people don't know what Congress is doing because it's too hard to find out.

You're busy. You have a job, maybe kids, life stuff. You can't spend hours reading 40-page bills written in legal language. But you still care. You want to know if your representative is voting on healthcare reform, or climate legislation, or education funding. You just need someone to make it accessible.

That's what I'm building: a civic engagement platform that makes Congress searchable, understandable, trackable, and actionable. Not for policy experts—for regular people who give a damn about democracy but don't have time to become experts.

### What I'm Building (So Far)

I'm competing in the Liquid Metal Hackathon (deadline: December 7, 2025), which means I'm building fast and learning faster. Civic Pulse is a platform with five integrated features:

**1. Smart Search**

I've loaded 5,858 bills from the 119th Congress into a database. The platform includes AI-powered semantic search that lets you find bills like a human, not a robot:
- "Climate change bills" → finds relevant legislation even if it doesn't use those exact words
- "What did my representative sponsor?" → shows their bills
- "Healthcare reform" → discovers related bills through semantic understanding

This works using AI semantic search (via Raindrop Platform's SmartBuckets) that understands concepts, not just keywords. Search "forest conservation" and it'll find the "Virginia Wilderness Additions Act" even though those words aren't in the title. It's like having someone who's read all 5,858 bills understand what you're looking for.

**How I Actually Built This:**

Here's what working with Claude Code looks like in practice:

**Me:** "I need to make search work for 5,858 bills. Users should be able to type normal questions like 'climate change bills' and get relevant results."

**Claude Code:** "Got it. Let's talk through the product flow first. How do you want the search results displayed? Should we show all results at once or paginate? What information needs to be visible immediately vs. on click?"

*(This is product thinking—Claude Code is teaching me UX, not just writing code.)*

**Claude Code:** "For the technical approach, we'll use semantic embeddings through SmartBuckets. Think of it like this: instead of matching exact words, we convert bill text into mathematical representations that capture meaning. Bills about 'climate' and 'environmental protection' end up close together in this mathematical space, even if they don't share words."

*(Now I understand the concept, not just the implementation.)*

**Claude Code:** "Here's the code for the SmartBucket integration. I'm using the Raindrop document-search tool with a similarity threshold of 0.7. That means results need to be 70% semantically similar to the query. Lower = more results but less relevant. Want me to explain why I chose these specific parameters?"

*(And now I'm learning the tradeoffs, not just copy-pasting code.)*

**Me:** "Wait, the search isn't working. I'm getting errors."

**Claude Code:** "Let me check the database connection. Ah, I see—the SmartBucket index wasn't created yet. Here's why that matters, here's how to create it, and here's what the error message means so you'll recognize it next time."

*(Debugging together, building mental models.)*

Three weeks ago, I didn't know what "semantic embeddings" or "database indexing" meant. Now I understand the tradeoffs between search precision and recall. I know why we need indexes for fast queries. I can explain to you why semantic search works better than keyword matching for this use case.

That's not because I took a bootcamp—it's because Claude Code taught me while we built.

**2. Bill Tracking**

Once you find a bill you care about, you can track it. Get alerts when:
- The bill moves to a new committee
- Your representatives vote on it
- Amendments get proposed
- It passes or fails

Your dashboard shows everything you're tracking with status updates and why each bill matters to YOUR issues.

**3. AI Insights**

Nobody has time to read a 40-page bill. The platform uses Claude AI to turn legal text into plain English:
- What does this bill actually do?
- Who does it affect?
- Why does it matter?
- Who supports it? Who opposes it?

All grounded in the actual Congressional Record—not summaries of summaries, but analysis of real bill text and floor speeches.

**4. Your Representatives**

Enter your zip code, see your 2 senators and 1 house member:
- What bills have they sponsored?
- How did they vote recently?
- What committees are they on?
- How do you contact them?

No more hunting across multiple government websites.

**5. Congressional News**

Breaking news from The Hill, personalized to the issues you care about. If you're tracking climate bills, you'll see headlines about climate legislation as they happen. The platform connects those headlines to the actual bills being discussed—see the full story, not just the news.

**6. (Maybe) Podcasts Too**

I'm experimenting with turning bills and daily news into podcast episodes:
- 5-7 minute daily briefs (quick morning update)
- 15-18 minute weekly deep dives (full analysis)

Using ElevenLabs voice AI, it sounds like two people having a natural conversation—not a robot reading text. Think NPR style, not government announcement.

But here's the thing: I'm not sure if people actually want this. Maybe everyone just wants to read summaries and track bills on their dashboard. I'm building it to test the idea, but I'm not married to it. That's the benefit of building in public—you can pivot based on feedback.

### How It's Going (Honestly)

**What's working:**
- The platform's integrated approach is coming together. All five features (search, tracking, AI insights, representatives, news) are feeding into a unified dashboard.
- The semantic search is genuinely impressive. I searched "student loan forgiveness" and it found bills about higher education debt relief that didn't use those exact words.
- Loading 5,858 bills from Congress.gov and connecting them across features was harder than expected, but it's done.
- The Raindrop Platform (the hackathon sponsor tech) is actually really elegant—integrated database, AI search, and memory in one system. Even someone without a developer background can use it because it abstracts away the complexity.

**What's hard:**
- **Learning to code while building under a deadline.** I'm racing against December 7 (39 days away), which means I'm Googling error messages, reading documentation at 2am, and asking Claude Code to explain why my database queries aren't working. There's no time for a coding bootcamp—I'm learning by building. Yesterday, The Hill RSS feed broke. Claude Code helped me debug it, showed me how to handle API errors gracefully, and explained what "try/catch blocks" are for. Now I understand error handling. That's how learning works when you're building something real.

- **Imposter syndrome is real.** Every time I fix a bug or get a feature working, part of me thinks "a real developer could've done this in half the time." But then I remember: a real developer might not have built this at all. Sometimes caring enough about a problem is more valuable than technical expertise. And Claude Code levels the playing field—it's not about knowing everything, it's about knowing how to ask the right questions and understand the answers.

- **Deciding what's essential vs. nice-to-have.** Do I need podcasts? Or should I focus on making the core platform features bulletproof? Claude Code has been helpful here too—when I describe a feature idea, it asks clarifying questions: "What problem does this solve? Is there a simpler way? What's the user flow?" That's product thinking, not just coding. I'm learning to think like a product manager while building like an engineer.

- **Congressional data is messy.** Bills have amendments, co-sponsors, committee assignments, votes... keeping all that synced and accurate is trickier than I expected. I didn't understand database schemas until Claude Code drew out the relationships: "Bills connect to representatives through co-sponsorships. Representatives connect to committees. Committees connect to bill actions. Here's why we need foreign keys." Now I get relational databases.

- **Making complex tech feel simple.** I can build all these features (with help), but can I make the platform feel so intuitive that my mom could use it? That's the real challenge. Claude Code writes the backend code, but I'm making the UX decisions. How do the five features work together? What should the dashboard feel like? AI can't answer those questions—only users can.

**What I'm learning:**

**Technical concepts (that I now actually understand):**
- **What semantic search really means:** Not just keyword matching, but understanding intent and meaning through mathematical representations
- **Why databases need indexes:** Without them, searching 5,858 bills would be slow. With them, it's instant. Claude Code showed me the performance difference.
- **What CORS errors are and how to fix them:** I didn't know what "cross-origin requests" meant until an API call failed. Claude Code explained it, fixed the error, and now I understand browser security.
- **How to structure API routes:** RESTful patterns, error handling, authentication middleware—these weren't just concepts I memorized, I built them and understand why they matter.
- **Database relationships:** Foreign keys, joins, normalization—Claude Code taught me relational database design by showing me what happens when you get it wrong.

**Product thinking (that Claude Code helped me develop):**
- **Feature prioritization:** Not "what's cool" but "what solves a user problem." When I suggested adding social sharing, Claude Code asked: "Does that help people track bills or is it a distraction?" It was a distraction.
- **User flows:** How does someone discover a bill? Track it? Get notified? Claude Code walks me through these flows: "Where does the user start? What do they click? What happens next?"
- **Information architecture:** What belongs on the dashboard? What's a separate page? How should search results display? These are product decisions, not code decisions.
- **Simplicity over complexity:** Claude Code suggested breaking the dashboard into cards instead of one long page. Better UX, easier to scan. That's design thinking.

**Development workflows (learned by doing):**
- **Testing early and often:** Build a feature, test it immediately, fix issues before moving on. Claude Code won't let me skip testing.
- **Version control with git:** Commit frequently, write clear messages, branch for features. Claude Code explains why this matters when debugging.
- **Environment variables for API keys:** Never hardcode secrets. Claude Code caught this mistake before I committed it.
- **Reading error messages properly:** That cryptic stack trace? Claude Code teaches me to read it, find the root cause, fix it systematically.

**The "why" behind code patterns:**
- It's not just "here's the code." It's "here's why we use async/await for API calls" and "here's why we're using TypeScript instead of JavaScript" and "here's why components should be small and focused."
- I'm not memorizing syntax—I'm learning principles. When to use a database query vs. an API call. When to cache data vs. fetch fresh. When to optimize vs. ship fast.

**The most important lesson:** Building software isn't about knowing everything—it's about knowing how to learn, how to debug, and how to ask good questions. Claude Code is teaching me all three simultaneously.

### What's Left To Build

Here's my honest to-do list before December 7:

**Must Have (Core Platform Features):**
- ✅ Search (done—5,858 bills loaded, semantic search working)
- ✅ AI insights (working via Claude API)
- ✅ Bill tracking (users can save bills to dashboard)
- ✅ Representative profiles (zip code → your 2 senators + rep)
- ✅ Congressional news (The Hill RSS feeds integrated)
- 🚧 Unified dashboard tying all 5 features together (in progress)
- ⏳ Authentication (WorkOS OAuth—almost done)
- ⏳ Alerts/notifications (email or SMS when tracked bills update)

**Nice To Have (If Time Allows):**
- ⏳ Podcast generation (audio version of summaries)
- ⏳ Subscription tiers (free vs. premium features)
- ⏳ Social sharing (share bills with friends)
- ⏳ Mobile app polish (works on mobile, but could be better)

**Definitely Not Happening (Yet):**
- Community features (comments, discussions)
- Advanced analytics (bill passage predictions, voting patterns)
- Chrome extension (quick-lookup from any site)
- API for developers

The hardest part? Knowing what to cut. I have ideas for 50 features, but only time for 10. That's the reality of building under a deadline.

### Why I'm Sharing This Journey

I believe in learning in public. Not because I've figured everything out (I definitely haven't), but because the process is valuable—for me and hopefully for you.

Here's what I'm learning:
- **Technical stuff:** How AI semantic search works, how to handle messy government data, how to make complex systems feel simple. And more importantly: *how to learn technical things* when you don't have a traditional coding background.
- **Product stuff:** What features actually matter vs. what sounds cool but nobody needs.
- **Civic tech stuff:** Democracy doesn't need more complexity—it needs more accessibility.

And honestly? Building in public keeps me accountable. Knowing people are reading this means I can't just abandon the project when it gets hard. (And trust me, it's gotten hard.)

### The Real Story: Claude Code Makes Building Accessible, But You Still Learn

Here's what I want to be clear about: **Claude Code is incredibly powerful, but I'm not just pressing a button and getting an app.**

I'm making every product decision:
- What features matter?
- How should the user flow work?
- What should this page look like?
- Is this feature solving a real problem or just cool?

I'm learning every technical concept:
- Why does semantic search work better than keyword search?
- What's the tradeoff between SQLite and PostgreSQL for this use case?
- How do you structure a database for bills, representatives, and votes?
- When do you optimize for speed vs. when do you ship fast and iterate?

I'm doing all the debugging:
- "This search isn't returning results." → Work with Claude Code to find why
- "The RSS feed broke." → Learn about error handling and API resilience
- "Users can't save bills to their dashboard." → Understand authentication and state management

**Claude Code democratizes building by being:**
1. **A code writer:** It writes the API routes, database queries, UI components
2. **A teacher:** It explains concepts before implementing them
3. **A product advisor:** It asks clarifying questions about features and user flows
4. **A debugging partner:** When something breaks, we figure it out together

This is NOT "AI wrote my app and I don't understand it." It's "AI is teaching me to build, and I'm learning deeply as I go."

The difference? I can explain every decision, every technical choice, every line of code. Because I didn't just get code—I got understanding.

**If I can build this without being a developer, then others can too.**

Too many people have ideas that could help their communities but think "I can't build that—I'm not technical." That's not true anymore. Tools like Claude Code have lowered the barriers dramatically. But you still need to:
- Care about the problem you're solving
- Be willing to learn constantly
- Push through frustration and mistakes
- Understand what you're building (not just copy code)
- Make product decisions and own your creation

The gate is open now. You don't need a CS degree. But you do need curiosity, persistence, and willingness to learn.

If me building Civic Pulse—with Claude Code as my co-builder and teacher—inspires even one person to try building the thing they've been dreaming about, then sharing this journey was worth it.

### How You Can Help

I'm not asking for money or signups yet. The project isn't ready. But here's how you can help:

**1. Follow Along**

I'm documenting the journey in my journal (`journal.md` in the project repo) and sharing updates on this Substack. Subscribe if you want to see how this unfolds—the wins, the failures, the "oh crap" moments.

**2. Give Feedback**

Does this sound useful? Would you actually use a tool like this? What am I missing? What features matter most to you?

Reply to this email or comment. I read everything. Your feedback shapes what I build.

**3. Test When Ready**

Once I hit the December 7 deadline and launch, I'll need beta testers. People to break things, find bugs, tell me what's confusing. If you're interested, let me know.

**4. Share If Interested**

Know someone who cares about civic engagement? Forward this. The more people interested, the more likely I'll actually finish this thing.

### The Timeline

**Today (October 29):** Core features working (search, tracking, insights, reps, news)
**November:** Unified dashboard, authentication, alerts, polish
**December 7:** Hackathon deadline—submit working platform
**December 8+:** Beta testing, bug fixes, user feedback, iteration

Can I pull this off? Honestly, I don't know. But I'm going to try. And I'm sharing the journey whether it succeeds or fails.

Because that's how learning works. You don't just share the polished final product—you share the messy process of figuring it out.

### Final Thought

Democracy shouldn't be a mystery. Congress shouldn't be inaccessible. And civic engagement shouldn't require a law degree.

I'm building Civic Pulse—a comprehensive platform that integrates search, tracking, AI insights, representative information, and news—to fix that. Not because I'm the most qualified person technically (I'm definitely not), but because I care enough to try—and because modern tools make it possible for someone like me to actually build something real.

If you care about making democracy more accessible—even if you're not technical, even if you've never thought about civic tech before—follow along. Share feedback. Help test when it's ready.

And if you've been sitting on an idea thinking "I could never build that," maybe this journey will show you that you can.

Let's make Congress accessible. Together.

P.S. - If you're curious about the technical details (Raindrop Platform, semantic search, AI summaries, etc.), check out my journal: [github.com/tarikmoody/civicpulse/journal.md]. I document every decision, every mistake, every "aha!" moment. It's detailed, it's honest, and it's probably too long—but that's learning in public.

Fair warning: you'll see me learning things that experienced developers would find basic. You'll see me ask Claude Code questions like "What's a foreign key?" and "Why do we need error handling?" But that's the point—you don't need to know everything to start building. You need to know how to learn, and Claude Code is teaching me that.

Every journal entry shows the conversation between me and Claude Code: the questions I asked, the concepts it explained, the decisions we made together. It's a record of learning, not just building.

P.P.S. - Next update: Early November. I'll share whether the dashboard is working, if authentication is solid, and whether I've decided to keep or cut the podcast feature. Stay tuned.

## Social Media Variations

### LinkedIn Version (1,300 characters)

I'm building Civic Pulse—a comprehensive civic engagement platform—and learning in public.

Plot twist: I'm not even a developer. But I care about democracy, and Claude Code is teaching me to build it anyway.

The problem: You hear about a bill on the news, want to track it, see how your rep voted, but you're stuck navigating multiple confusing government websites with zero context.

The platform I'm building (deadline: Dec 7, 2025):
• Smart search: Find bills using AI semantic search (understands concepts, not just keywords)
• Bill tracking: Get alerts when legislation you care about moves forward
• AI insights: 2-minute summaries vs. 40 pages of legal text
• Your representatives: See their votes, sponsored bills, contact info
• Congressional news: Breaking updates personalized to your interests

All five features integrated into one dashboard. Built on Raindrop Platform for the Liquid Metal Hackathon. Real data from Congress.gov.

**How I'm building this:** Claude Code is my co-builder and teacher. It's not just writing code—it's explaining concepts ("here's why semantic search works"), teaching product thinking ("what problem does this solve?"), and debugging with me ("here's what that error means").

Three weeks ago, I didn't know what semantic embeddings or database indexing meant. Now I can explain the technical tradeoffs because Claude Code taught me while we built.

This isn't "AI wrote my app." It's "AI is teaching me to build, and I'm learning deeply as I go."

Why I'm sharing: If I can build this without a CS degree, others can too. Modern tools have democratized software development—but you still need to learn, understand, and make decisions.

How you can help: Follow along, give feedback, test when ready.

Let's make democracy more accessible.
