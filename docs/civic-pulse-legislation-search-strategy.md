## **Understanding the Search Challenge**

### **The Problem We're Solving**

Imagine you're standing in a library with 10,000 books, but there's no card catalog, no Dewey Decimal System, and the books aren't even organized alphabetically. That's essentially what searching congressional legislation feels like without a proper search system.

Every two-year congressional session produces thousands of bills. The 119th Congress (2025-2026) will likely introduce 8,000-12,000 bills. Add historical congresses, and we're talking about 100,000+ bills in our database within a few years.

Users come to Civic Pulse with questions like:

- "What's Congress doing about student loan debt?"  
- "Show me bills about climate change that actually have a chance of passing"  
- "What education bills has my representative sponsored?"  
- "I heard about HR 5544 on the news, what is it?"

Each of these queries requires different search capabilities. We need a system that's simultaneously:

- **Fast** \- Results in under 200 milliseconds  
- **Smart** \- Understands what users really mean  
- **Comprehensive** \- Searches across titles, summaries, sponsors, topics  
- **Flexible** \- Handles everything from bill numbers to natural language  
- **Personalized** \- Prioritizes what's relevant to each user

This is where Algolia becomes essential.

## **The Search User Journey: Three Distinct Paths**

### **Path 1: The Directed Search (20% of searches)**

**The Scenario**: Maria hears on NPR that "H.R. 5544 just passed the House committee." She wants to know what it is and whether she should care.

**Her Journey**:

1. She opens Civic Pulse and types "HR 5544" into the search bar  
2. As she types "HR 5", autocomplete suggestions appear:  
   - HR 5544 \- Student Loan Interest Rate Cap Act  
   - HR 5521 \- Medicare Expansion Act  
   - HR 5500 \- Infrastructure Maintenance Act  
3. She sees her exact bill highlighted at the top  
4. One click, she's on the bill detail page  
5. Total time: 5 seconds

**What Makes This Work**:

- Instant recognition of bill number patterns (HR, S, HRES, etc.)  
- Autocomplete that shows real bills, not just text suggestions  
- Fuzzy matching (if she types "HR5544" without a space, it still works)  
- Exact matches always surface first

---

### **Path 2: The Exploratory Search (60% of searches)**

**The Scenario**: David is a high school civics teacher preparing a unit on environmental policy. He wants to find bills about climate change that are currently active and have bipartisan support, so his students can see real legislative compromise in action.

**His Journey**:

1. He types "climate change" into the search bar  
2. Before he even hits enter, he sees:  
   - 127 bills mention "climate change"  
   - Suggested filters appear: "Active bills only" | "Bipartisan" | "This Congress"  
3. He selects all three filters  
4. Results narrow to 12 bills  
5. He sorts by "Most likely to pass" (a custom ranking we provide)  
6. He scans the titles and summaries, which highlight his search terms  
7. He finds three perfect bills for class debate  
8. He clicks "Add to Teaching Collection" on each  
9. Total time: 2 minutes

**What Makes This Work**:

- Real-time faceted search (filters update as you type)  
- Smart suggestions based on common patterns  
- Highlighting shows *why* a bill matched  
- Multiple sorting options beyond relevance  
- Results refine without page reloads  
- Clear count of total results

---

### **Path 3: The Discovery Search (20% of searches)**

**The Scenario**: Sarah is a parent concerned about her kids' education. She doesn't know specific keywords or bill numbers. She just knows she wants to see "what Congress is doing about schools."

**Her Journey**:

1. She types "what is congress doing about schools"  
2. The system understands this natural language query  
3. It automatically translates to search for: education \+ K-12 \+ schools \+ funding \+ teachers  
4. Results show bills tagged with "Education" topic  
5. She sees filters for subtopics: "K-12 Education" | "School Funding" | "Teacher Pay" | "School Safety"  
6. She explores each subtopic  
7. She discovers bills she didn't even know to search for  
8. She starts tracking three bills about school funding  
9. Total time: 5 minutes

**What Makes This Work**:

- Natural language processing that extracts intent  
- Synonym understanding (schools \= K-12 education)  
- Topic-based organization  
- Related searches suggested  
- "People also searched for..." recommendations  
- Educational tooltips explaining legislative categories

## **The Basic Search System (Without Algolia)**

Let me first explain what we'd build without Algolia, so you understand why Algolia matters.

### **Traditional Database Search Approach**

Using just PostgreSQL, our search would work like this:

```
User types: "student loans"

Our server runs a database query:
SELECT * FROM bills 
WHERE title ILIKE '%student%loans%' 
   OR summary ILIKE '%student%loans%'
ORDER BY introduced_date DESC
LIMIT 50

Results return in 800-1200 milliseconds
```

**The Problems**:

**1\. Speed Issues**

- Scanning text fields in a database is slow  
- As the database grows to 100,000 bills, searches take 2-3 seconds  
- Users get frustrated and leave

**2\. Relevance Problems**

- A bill with "student loans" in the title ranks the same as one where it's mentioned once in a 50-page summary  
- No way to boost important bills  
- Can't consider multiple relevance factors

**3\. Typo Intolerance**

- User types "studet loans" \- zero results  
- Database doesn't know they meant "student"  
- Frustrated user leaves

**4\. No Autocomplete**

- User has to type full query and hit enter  
- Can't explore suggestions  
- Slower, less intuitive experience

**5\. Limited Filtering**

- Applying multiple filters requires complex SQL queries  
- Each filter combination requires a new database query  
- Slow and resource-intensive

**6\. No Personalization**

- Can't boost results based on user's location, interests, or tracked bills  
- Everyone sees identical results  
- Less relevant experience

**7\. Synonym Blindness**

- Search for "climate change" misses bills about "global warming" or "carbon emissions"  
- User has to know exact terminology  
- Misses relevant results

---

## **The Algolia-Enhanced Search System**

Now let's see how Algolia transforms this experience.

### **What is Algolia?**

Algolia is a hosted search engine specifically designed for websites and apps. Think of it as Google-quality search for your application. Instead of searching a database, you search a specialized search index optimized for speed and relevance.

**Key Advantages**:

- Searches complete in under 50 milliseconds (10-20x faster)  
- Sophisticated relevance ranking  
- Built-in typo tolerance  
- Instant autocomplete  
- Faceted search (filters)  
- Personalization capabilities  
- Geographic search  
- Synonym support  
- Highlighting  
- Analytics on what users search for

## **The Complete Architecture: From Congress.gov to User Results**

### **Phase 1: Data Ingestion and Indexing**

**Step 1: Fetch Bills from Congress.gov** Our sync service runs every 15 minutes, fetching new and updated bills from the Congress.gov API. We store the complete data in PostgreSQL (our source of truth).

**Step 2: Transform for Search** Before sending to Algolia, we transform each bill into a search-optimized format:

```javascript
{
  // Unique identifier
  objectID: "119-hr-5544",
  
  // Primary searchable content
  billNumber: "HR 5544",
  title: "Student Loan Interest Rate Cap Act of 2025",
  shortTitle: "Student Loan Interest Cap Act",
  summary: "This bill establishes a federal program to cap interest rates on student loans at 4% for all federal loans...",
  plainEnglishSummary: "This bill would limit how much interest the government can charge on student loans to 4%, making loans more affordable for students...",
  
  // Sponsor information (searchable)
  sponsorName: "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez",
  sponsorParty: "Democratic",
  sponsorState: "NY",
  
  // Cosponsors (searchable)
  cosponsorNames: ["Gwen Moore", "Bernie Sanders", "Elizabeth Warren", ...],
  cosponsorCount: 34,
  
  // Topics (faceted filters)
  policyArea: "Education",
  topics: ["Higher Education", "Student Aid", "Interest Rates", "Federal Loans"],
  
  // Status information (faceted filters)
  currentStatus: "committee",
  statusCategory: "active", // active, passed, failed, law
  congress: 119,
  chamber: "house", // house, senate, both
  
  // Dates
  introducedDate: "2025-09-15",
  lastActionDate: "2025-10-28",
  introducedTimestamp: 1726416000, // Unix timestamp for sorting
  
  // Relevance signals
  cosponsorshipScore: 0.68, // 34 cosponsors out of 50 possible = high support
  bipartisanScore: 0.35, // 35% of cosponsors are Republicans
  progressScore: 0.4, // Committee stage = 40% through process
  mediaAttention: 12, // Number of news articles mentioning this bill
  
  // Geographic relevance
  statesAffected: ["all"], // or specific states if applicable
  impactScope: "national", // national, regional, state-specific
  
  // User engagement signals (updated regularly)
  trackingCount: 847, // How many users are tracking this
  
  // Search optimization
  _tags: [
    "education",
    "student-loans", 
    "active",
    "bipartisan",
    "house",
    "congress-119"
  ]
}
```

**Step 3: Send to Algolia** We use Algolia's API to index this data. Each bill becomes a searchable record in our Algolia index.

**Step 4: Configure Search Settings** This is where the magic happens. We tell Algolia how to search:

**Searchable Attributes (in priority order)**:

1. `billNumber` (highest priority \- exact matches surface first)  
2. `title` (high priority \- main searchable content)  
3. `shortTitle`  
4. `plainEnglishSummary` (medium priority)  
5. `summary`  
6. `sponsorName`  
7. `cosponsorNames`  
8. `topics`

**Custom Ranking Attributes**: When relevance is equal, Algolia uses these to break ties:

1. `trackingCount` (DESC) \- Popular bills rank higher  
2. `progressScore` (DESC) \- Bills further along rank higher  
3. `bipartisanScore` (DESC) \- Bipartisan bills rank higher  
4. `introducedTimestamp` (DESC) \- Newer bills rank higher

**Facets (Filters)**:

- `congress`  
- `statusCategory`  
- `chamber`  
- `policyArea`  
- `topics`  
- `sponsorParty`  
- `statesAffected`  
- `bipartisanScore` (ranges: 0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4+)

**Synonyms**: We configure synonyms so searches understand legislative terminology:

- "climate change" ↔ "global warming" ↔ "carbon emissions"  
- "healthcare" ↔ "health care" ↔ "medical care"  
- "student loans" ↔ "student debt" ↔ "college loans"  
- "guns" ↔ "firearms" ↔ "second amendment"  
- "immigration" ↔ "border security" ↔ "citizenship"

**Typo Tolerance**:

- 1-4 characters: No typos allowed (too ambiguous)  
- 5-8 characters: 1 typo allowed  
- 9+ characters: 2 typos allowed

---

### **Phase 2: The Search Experience**

Now let's walk through what happens when a user searches.

### **Scenario: User Types "student loans"**

**Character 1: 's'** Nothing happens yet (waiting for at least 3 characters).

**Character 3: 'stu'** Algolia query fires (200ms debounce to avoid excessive queries).

Algolia searches its index and returns in 23 milliseconds:

- 423 bills contain "stu"  
- Top suggestions for autocomplete:  
  - "student loans" (423 bills)  
  - "student aid" (312 bills)  
  - "student debt" (287 bills)

These suggestions appear in a dropdown below the search bar.

**Character 11: 'student lo'**

Algolia returns updated results in 19 milliseconds:

- 127 bills match  
- Suggestions refine:  
  - "student loans" (127 bills)  
  - "student loan forgiveness" (45 bills)  
  - "student loan interest rates" (23 bills)

**User hits Enter or selects "student loans"**

Full search results page loads with:

**Results (Ordered by Relevance)**:

**Result 1:**

```

### **Advanced Search Interactions**

**Scenario 1: Applying Filters**

User clicks "Bipartisan Support: High"

Algolia instantly re-queries with filter:

```javascript
filters: 'bipartisanScore >= 0.4'
```

Results update in 31 milliseconds to show just 15 bills. All the counts in other filters update too:

- "Active in Congress" now shows (13) instead of (98)  
- "Democratic" shows (8) instead of (89)  
- "Republican" shows (7) instead of (38)

This dynamic filter updating helps users understand their data.

**Scenario 2: Sorting**

By default, results are sorted by relevance. But users can change this:

```
Sort by: [Relevance ▼]
```

Clicking reveals options:

- Relevance (default)  
- Most Recent  
- Most Popular (by tracking count)  
- Most Likely to Pass  
- Alphabetical

Selecting "Most Likely to Pass" re-sorts using our custom `progressScore` ranking.

**Scenario 3: Searching by Bill Number**

User types "HR 5544"

Algolia recognizes this as a bill number pattern (starts with HR/S/HJRES/SJRES etc. followed by numbers).

It automatically:

1. Boosts the `billNumber` attribute to maximum weight  
2. Looks for exact and near-exact matches  
3. Returns that specific bill as the \#1 result

If there's an exact match, we show a special highlighted result:

```
🎯 EXACT MATCH

HR 5544 - Student Loan Interest Rate Cap Act
[View Bill Details →]

Did you mean:
• HR 5545 - Student Protection Act
• HR 5444 - Education Funding Act
```

---

### **Phase 3: Personalized Search**

This is where Algolia really shines. We can personalize results for each user.

### **Personalization Factors**

**User Location (Wisconsin)** When a user from Wisconsin searches "infrastructure", we boost:

- Bills affecting Wisconsin specifically  
- Bills sponsored by Wisconsin representatives  
- Bills about issues relevant to the Midwest (e.g., Great Lakes protection)

We send this context to Algolia:

```javascript
{
  filters: '',
  optionalFilters: [
    'statesAffected:WI<score=2>',
    'sponsorState:WI<score=3>'
  ]
}
```

This doesn't filter out other results, but it boosts Wisconsin-relevant bills in the ranking.

**User's Tracked Topics (Education, Healthcare)** When a user who follows "Education" searches "funding", bills tagged with "Education" get boosted higher than bills about defense funding or infrastructure funding.

**User's Representative Context** If your representative sponsored or cosponsored a bill, that bill gets boosted in your search results. You see a badge: "Your Rep: Gwen Moore is a cosponsor"

**User's Role (Teacher)** Teachers see additional metadata in results:

- "Good for classroom debate" badge  
- "Reading level: 9-10th grade"  
- "Teaching resources available"

These signals help teachers find appropriate bills faster.

**Historical Search Behavior** If a user frequently searches for and tracks climate bills, future searches for related topics will prioritize environmental legislation.

---

### **Phase 4: Search Analytics & Improvement**

Algolia provides powerful analytics that help us improve search over time.

**Metrics We Track**:

**Top Searches**

1. "student loans" \- 1,247 searches this month

  - Action: Add synonym mapping, index relevant bills  
- "prescription drug costs" \- 28 searches, 0 results  
  - Action: Review why relevant bills aren't matching

**Searches with No Clicks**

- "tax reform" returns 234 results but users don't click any  
  - Problem: Results aren't relevant or titles aren't clear  
  - Action: Review relevance configuration, improve summaries

**Click-Through Rate**

- Overall CTR: 76% (healthy)  
- "climate change": 82% CTR (excellent)  
- "budget": 43% CTR (needs improvement)

**Time to First Click**

- Average: 8.3 seconds (good \- users are finding what they need quickly)  
- Goal: Keep under 10 seconds

**Conversion Rate**

## **Search UI/UX Patterns**

### **The Search Bar Component**

The search bar is always visible at the top of every page in Civic Pulse.

**Design Principles**:

**1\. Prominent Placement** The search bar is in the header, always accessible. Users can hit `/` key from anywhere to focus the search bar (like GitHub or Notion).

**2\. Smart Autocomplete** As users type, we show three types of suggestions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ student loans                         [x]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  
  BILLS
  ─────
  HR 5544 - Student Loan Interest Rate Cap Act
  S 2341 - Student Debt Relief Act
  HR 4892 - Student Loan Refinancing Act
  
  TOPICS
  ─────
  Student Aid (127 bills)
  Student Loans (127 bills)
  
  REPRESENTATIVES
  ─────
  Rep. Smith (Chair, Education Committee)
  
  POPULAR SEARCHES
  ─────
  student loan forgiveness
  student debt cancellation
```

Users can keyboard-navigate these suggestions (arrow keys \+ enter) or click.

**3\. Recent Searches** When the search bar is focused but empty, show the user's last 5 searches:

```
Recent Searches:
• climate change
• HR 5544
• healthcare bills
• my representative's bills
```

One-click to re-run those searches.

**4\. Search Shortcuts** Power users can use shortcuts:

- `sponsor:moore` \- Bills sponsored by Rep. Moore  
- `status:active` \- Only active bills  
- `topic:education` \- Education bills  
- `number:HR 5544` \- Specific bill number

We show a "?" button that reveals all shortcuts.

**5\. Voice Search (Future)** Microphone icon for voice search. User can say "Show me student loan bills" and we process it.

```

**Key Features**:

**Instant Filter Updates** Clicking any filter immediately updates results without page reload. The URL updates too, so users can bookmark or share searches: `civicpulse.com/search?q=student+loans&status=active&bipartisan=high`

**Highlighted Search Terms** In results, the user's search terms are bolded: "This bill limits interest rates on federal **student loans** to 4%..."

This helps users quickly scan and understand why each result matched.

**Contextual Information** Each result shows:

- Bill number and title  
- Current status with visual indicator (color-coded)  
- Sponsor with party and state  
- Cosponsor count  
- Introduction date  
- Brief summary with highlighted terms  
- Action buttons

**Responsive Design** On mobile, filters move to a collapsible drawer. Results stack vertically for easy scrolling.

**Loading States** When searching or applying filters, we show skeleton screens (gray boxes where content will appear) rather than spinners. This feels faster to users.

**Empty States** If a search returns zero results:

```
No bills found for "studet loans"

Did you mean: student loans? [Search instead]

Tips for better results:
• Check your spelling
• Try different keywords
• Use fewer filters
• Search for broader topics

Or browse by topic:
[Education] [Healthcare] [Environment]
```

---

## **Special Search Modes**

### **1\. Natural Language Search**

When users type questions rather than keywords, we extract intent:

**User types**: "What is Congress doing about climate change?"

**Processing**:

1. Detect question pattern  
2. Extract topic: "climate change"  
3. Imply recency filter: recent bills  
4. Search Algolia with extracted keywords

**Results**: Show bills tagged with "Environment" / "Climate" introduced in the past 6 months, sorted by progress (most advanced first).

Add helpful context: "Showing recent bills about climate change. Filter to see historical legislation."

---

### **2\. Representative-Specific Search**

**User types**: "gwen moore bills"

**Processing**:

1. Recognize "Gwen Moore" as a representative name  
2. Apply automatic filter: `sponsorName:"Gwen Moore"`  
3. Show all bills she's sponsored

**Enhanced UI**:

```
Results for bills sponsored by Rep. Gwen Moore (D-WI-4)

[View Rep. Moore's Full Profile]

Showing 47 bills sponsored in 119th Congress

Sort by: [Most Recent ▼]
Filter by topic: [All Topics ▼]
```

Users can refine further: "gwen moore education bills"

---

### **3\. Comparative Search**

## **Search for Teachers: Special Considerations**

Teachers have unique search needs. We cater to these:

### **"Good for Teaching" Filter**

When a teacher searches, they see an additional filter:

```
Teaching Suitability
☐ Excellent for debate (23)
☐ Clear party differences (45)
☐ Bipartisan examples (15)
☐ Local relevance (8)
☐ Current events (12)
☐ Historical comparison available (19)
```

These are calculated based on:

- Reading level of bill text  
- Complexity of topic  
- Availability of teaching resources  
- Balance of perspectives  
- Media coverage (current events)

### **Classroom Collections**

Teachers can search within curated collections:

```
Search in: [All Bills ▼]
           ↓
           [All Bills]
           [My Collections]
           [Popular Classroom Bills]
           [Current Events]
           [Historical Comparison Sets]
           [Mock Congress Recommended]
```

Each collection is a filtered view optimized for education.

### **Reading Level Filters**

```
Reading Level
○ Middle School (6-8th grade)
○ High School (9-12th grade)
○ Advanced (College+)
```

This filters based on our AI-generated plain English summaries, not the official legal text.

## **Technical Implementation with Algolia**

### **Setup and Configuration**

**Step 1: Create Algolia Account and Index**

```javascript
// backend/config/algolia.js

const algoliasearch = require('algoliasearch');

const client = algoliasearch(
  process.env.ALGOLIA_APP_ID,
  process.env.ALGOLIA_API_KEY
);

const billsIndex = client.initIndex('bills');
```

**Step 2: Configure Index Settings**

```javascript
// backend/scripts/configureAlgoliaIndex.js

billsIndex.setSettings({
  // Attributes to search in (ordered by importance)
  searchableAttributes: [
    'billNumber',        // Most important
    'title',
    'shortTitle',
    'plainEnglishSummary',
    'summary',
    'sponsorName',
    'cosponsorNames',
    'topics'
  ],
  
  // Attributes for faceting (filtering)
  attributesForFaceting: [
    'filterOnly(congress)',
    'statusCategory',
    'chamber',
    'policyArea',
    'searchable(topics)',
    'sponsorParty',
    'filterOnly(statesAffected)',
    'bipartisanScore'
  ],
  
  // Custom ranking (when text relevance is equal)
  customRanking: [
    'desc(trackingCount)',
    'desc(progressScore)',
    'desc(bipartisanScore)',
    'desc(introducedTimestamp)'
  ],
  
  // Attributes to highlight in results
  attributesToHighlight: [
    'title',
    'plainEnglishSummary',
    'summary'
  ],
  
  // Typo tolerance
  minWordSizefor1Typo: 4,
  minWordSizefor2Typos: 8,
  
  // Advanced settings
  hitsPerPage: 20,
  attributesToRetrieve: ['*'],  // Get all attributes
  responseFields: ['*'],         // Return all fields
  
  // Pagination
  paginationLimitedTo: 1000,
  
  // Exact matching
  exactOnSingleWordQuery: 'attribute',
  
  // Ranking formula customization
  ranking: [
    'typo',
    'geo',
    'words',
    'filters',
    'proximity',
    'attribute',
    'exact',
    'custom'
  ]
});
```

**Step 3: Configure Synonyms**

```javascript
billsIndex.saveSynonyms([
  {
    objectID: 'climate-synonyms',
    synonyms: ['climate change', 'global warming', 'carbon emissions', 'greenhouse gases']
  },
  {
    objectID: 'healthcare-synonyms',
    synonyms: ['healthcare', 'health care', 'medical care', 'medicare', 'medicaid']
  },
  {
    objectID: 'student-debt-synonyms',
    synonyms: ['student loans', 'student debt', 'college loans', 'education debt']
  }
], {
  replaceExistingSynonyms: true
});
```

### **Indexing Data Flow**

**When a Bill is Created or Updated**:

```javascript
// backend/services/billIndexer.js

async function indexBill(bill) {
  // Transform database bill to Algolia format
  const algoliaRecord = {
    objectID: bill.id,
    billNumber: `${bill.type.toUpperCase()} ${bill.number}`,
    title: bill.title,
    plainEnglishSummary: bill.plain_summary,
    summary: bill.full_data.bill.summary,
    
    sponsorName: bill.full_data.bill.sponsors[0]?.name,
    sponsorParty: bill.full_data.bill.sponsors[0]?.party,
    sponsorState: bill.full_data.bill.sponsors[0]?.state,
    
    cosponsorNames: bill.full_data.bill.cosponsors?.map(c => c.name) || [],
    cosponsorCount: bill.full_data.bill.cosponsors?.length || 0,
    
    policyArea: bill.full_data.bill.subjects?.policyArea?.name,
    topics: bill.full_data.bill.subjects?.legislativeSubjects?.map(s => s.name) || [],
    
    currentStatus: bill.current_status,
    statusCategory: determineStatusCategory(bill.current_status),
    congress: bill.congress,
    chamber: bill.type.startsWith('h') ? 'house' : 'senate',
    
    introducedDate: bill.introduced_date,
    lastActionDate: bill.latest_action.actionDate,
    introducedTimestamp: new Date(bill.introduced_date).getTime() / 1000,
    
    // Calculate relevance scores
    bipartisanScore: calculateBipartisanScore(bill),
    progressScore: calculateProgressScore(bill),
    
    // Get user engagement data
    trackingCount: await getTrackingCount(bill.id),
    
    _tags: generateTags(bill)
  };
  
  // Send to Algolia
  await billsIndex.saveObject(algoliaRecord);
}

// Batch indexing for efficiency
async function indexBillsBatch(bills) {
  const records = await Promise.all(
    bills.map(bill => transformToAlgoliaRecord(bill))
  );
  
  await billsIndex.saveObjects(records);
}
```

**Incremental Updates**: Our sync service updates Algolia every 15 minutes:

```javascript
// Only index bills that changed
const changedBills = await db.query(
  'SELECT * FROM bills WHERE last_updated > $1',
  [lastSyncTime]
);

await indexBillsBatch(changedBills);
```

### **Frontend Search Implementation**

**React Component with InstantSearch**:

```javascript
// frontend/src/components/Search/SearchPage.jsx

import { InstantSearch, SearchBox, Hits, RefinementList, Configure } from 'react-instantsearch-dom';
import algoliasearch from 'algoliasearch/lite';

const searchClient = algoliasearch(
  ALGOLIA_APP_ID,
  ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY  // Public search-only key
);

function SearchPage() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <InstantSearch
      searchClient={searchClient}
      indexName="bills"
    >
      {/* Configuration */}
      <Configure
        hitsPerPage={20}
        optionalFilters={[
          // Boost user's state
          `statesAffected:${user.state}<score=2>`,
          // Boost user's topics
          ...user.followedTopics.map(topic => `topics:${topic}<score=1>`)
        ]}
      />
      
      {/* Search UI */}
      <div className="search-page">
        {/* Search Bar */}
        <SearchBox
          placeholder="Search bills, topics, or representatives..."
          autoFocus
        />
        
        <div className="search-layout">
          {/* Filters Sidebar */}
          <aside className="filters">
            <RefinementList attribute="statusCategory" />
            <RefinementList attribute="policyArea" />
            <RefinementList attribute="topics" searchable limit={10} />
            <RefinementList attribute="sponsorParty" />
          </aside>
          
          {/* Results */}
          <main className="results">
            <Hits hitComponent={BillHit} />
          </main>
        </div>
      </div>
    </InstantSearch>
  );
}

// Custom hit component
function BillHit({ hit }) {
  return (
    <div className="bill-hit">
      <h3>
        <span className="bill-number">{hit.billNumber}</span> - {' '}
        <Highlight attribute="title" hit={hit} />
      </h3>
      
      <div className="bill-meta">
        <StatusBadge status={hit.currentStatus} />
        <span>{formatDate(hit.introducedDate)}</span>
        <span>{hit.sponsorName} ({hit.sponsorParty}-{hit.sponsorState})</span>
        {hit.cosponsorCount > 0 && (
          <span>{hit.cosponsorCount} cosponsors</span>
        )}
        {hit.bipartisanScore > 0.4 && (
          <Badge>Bipartisan</Badge>
        )}
      </div>
      
      <p className="bill-summary">
        <Snippet attribute="plainEnglishSummary" hit={hit} />
      </p>
      
      <div className="bill-actions">
        <button onClick={() => trackBill(hit.objectID)}>
          Track Bill
        </button>
        <Link to={`/bills/${hit.objectID}`}>
          View Details
        </Link>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Autocomplete Implementation**:

```javascript
// frontend/src/components/Search/Autocomplete.jsx

import { autocomplete } from '@algolia/autocomplete-js';
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

function SearchAutocomplete() {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const search = autocomplete({
      container: containerRef.current,
      placeholder: 'Search bills...',
      getSources({ query }) {
        return [
          {
            sourceId: 'bills',
            getItems() {
              return algoliasearch.search([
                {
                  indexName: 'bills',
                  query,
                  params: {
                    hitsPerPage: 5
                  }
                }
              ]);
            },
            templates: {
              item({ item, components }) {
                return (
                  <div className="autocomplete-item">
                    <div className="bill-number">{item.billNumber}</div>
                    <div className="bill-title">
                      <components.Highlight hit={item} attribute="title" />
                    </div>
                  </div>
                );
              }
            }
          },
          {
            sourceId: 'suggestions',
            getItems() {
              return [
                { label: 'student loan forgiveness', query: 'student loan forgiveness' },
                { label: 'climate change bills', query: 'climate change' }
              ];
            },
            templates: {
              item({ item }) {
                return `🔍 ${item.label}`;
              }
            }
          }
        ];
      }
    });
    
    return () => search.destroy();
  }, []);
  
  return <div ref={containerRef} />;
}
```

### **Performance Optimization**

**Caching Strategy**:

```javascript
// Cache Algolia results for 5 minutes
const searchWithCache = async (query, filters) => {
  const cacheKey = `search:${query}:${JSON.stringify(filters)}`;
  
  const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
  if (cached) {
    return JSON.parse(cached);
  }
  
  const results = await billsIndex.search(query, filters);
  
  await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(results));
  
  return results;
};
```

**Debouncing**: Frontend debounces search queries to avoid excessive API calls:

```javascript
const debouncedSearch = debounce((query) => {
  algoliaSearch(query);
}, 200); // Wait 200ms after user stops typing
```

**Progressive Enhancement**:

- Initial page load: Server-side render first 20 results  
- Client-side: Hydrate with Algolia for instant filtering/sorting  
- Offline: Show cached results with "Results may be outdated" message

---

### **Cost Management**

Algolia pricing is based on operations:

- **Search operations**: Unlimited  
- **Records**: First 10,000 free, then tiered pricing  
- **Indexing operations**: Limited per month

**Our Strategy**:

- \~50,000 bills in database → \~50,000 Algolia records  
- Update only changed records (incremental indexing)  
- Estimated cost: $50-100/month for first year  
- Scale to $200-300/month at 1,000+ daily active users

This is worth it for the search quality improvement.

---

## **Measuring Search Success**

### **Key Metrics**

**Search Performance**:

- Query latency: Target \< 100ms (Algolia typically delivers 20-50ms)  
- Time to first result: Target \< 200ms total (including network)  
- Result relevance: CTR should be \> 70%

**User Engagement**:

- % of sessions that include search: Target 60%+  
- Searches per session: Target 1.5-2.5  
- Search → bill detail: Target 65%+  
- Search → track bill: Target 30%+

**Search Quality**:

- Zero-result searches: Target \< 5%  
- Refined searches (user changes query): Target \< 30%  
- Filter usage: Target 40%+ of searches use at least one filter

**Educational Impact**:

- Teacher search success: Target 80%+ find appropriate bills within 3 searches  
- Student comprehension: Target 75%+ understand search results

---

## **The Bottom Line: Why Algolia is Worth It**

Without Algolia, we'd spend months building and optimizing search, and still not match its quality. With Algolia:

✅ **Launch with excellent search from day one** ✅ **Search that feels instant** (20-50ms vs. 800-1200ms) ✅ **Sophisticated features out of the box** (typo tolerance, synonyms, faceting) ✅ **Scales automatically** as we grow ✅ **Analytics included** to improve over time ✅ **Maintained and improved** by Algolia, not our team

The investment (\~$50-300/month) pays for itself in:

- User satisfaction and retention  
- Development time saved (months of engineering)  
- Reduced server load (searches don't hit our database)  
- Better educational outcomes (students find relevant bills faster)

Search is the heart of Civic Pulse. With Algolia, we build that heart right from the start.

---

**This is how we make 10,000 bills instantly discoverable, comprehensible, and actionable for every user \- from busy citizens to engaged teachers to curious students. Search isn't just a feature; it's the gateway to civic engagement.**
