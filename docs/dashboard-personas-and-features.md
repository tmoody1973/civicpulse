Success = Sarah uses it daily for 10 minutes AND Marcus uses it hourly as a professional tool.

**Next Steps:**
1. Validate personas with real users (5 interviews each)
2. Build MVP for engaged citizens first (larger addressable market)
3. Add professional journalist tools in Phase 3
4. Continuously measure engagement and iterate based on actual usage patterns
