RES. 58 Denouncing the horrors of socialism. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES October 24, 2025 Ms. Salazar (for herself, Mr. Scalise, Mr. Huizenga, Mr. Smith of New Jersey, Mr. Gimenez, Mr. Diaz-Balart, Mr. Wilson of South Carolina, Mr. Burchett, Mrs. Kim, Mr. Nehls, Mr. Moolenaar, Mr. Jackson of Texas, Mr. Webster of Florida, Mr. Cloud, Mr. Ciscomani, Mr. Turner of Ohio, Mr. Aderholt, Mr. Moore of Alabama, Mrs. Miller-Meeks, Mr. Fulcher, Mr. Hurd of Colorado, Mr. Carter of Georgia, Mr. Fry, Mr. Estes, Mr. McDowell, Mr. Arrington, Ms. Stefanik, Mr. Moore of North Carolina, Mr. Baird, Ms. Tenney, Mr. Walberg, Mrs. Miller of Illinois, Mr. McGuire, Mr. Allen, Mr. Ogles, Mr. Moore of West Virginia, Mr. Newhouse, Mr. Lawler, Mr. McCaul, Mr. Cline, Mr. Rulli, Mr. Williams of Texas, Ms. Letlow, Mr. Rose, Mr. Haridopolos, Mr. Babin, Mr. Mills, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Bilirakis, Mr. Weber of Texas, Mr. Calvert, Mrs. Hinson, Mrs. Fischbach, Mr. Bacon, Mr. Tony Gonzales of Texas, Mr. Langworthy, and Mr. Garbarino) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Financial Services _______________________________________________________________________ CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Denouncing the horrors of socialism. Whereas socialist ideology necessitates a concentration of power that has, time and time again, collapsed into communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships; Whereas socialism has repeatedly led to famine and mass murders, and the killing of over 100,000,000 people worldwide; Whereas many of the greatest crimes in history were committed by socialist ideologues, including Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, Daniel Ortega, Hugo Chavez, and Nicolas Maduro; Whereas tens of millions died in the Bolshevik Revolution, at least 10,000,000 people were sent to the gulags in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and millions more starved in the Terror-Famine (Holodomor) in Ukraine; Whereas between 15,000,000 and 55,000,000 people starved to death in the wake of famine and devastation caused by the Great Leap Forward in China; Whereas the socialist experiment in Cambodia led to the killing fields in which over a million people were gruesomely murdered; Whereas up to 3,500,000 people have starved in North Korea, dividing a land of freedom from a land of destitution; Whereas the Castro regime in Cuba expropriated the land of Cuban farmers and the businesses of Cuban entrepreneurs, stealing their possessions and their livelihoods, and exiling millions with nothing but the clothes on their backs; Whereas the implementation of socialism in Venezuela has turned a once- prosperous country into a failed State with the highest rate of inflation in the world; Whereas President Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, wrote, ``To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it''; Whereas President James Madison, the ``Father of the Constitution'', wrote that it ``is not a just government, nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has in his personal safety and personal liberty, is violated by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens for the service of the rest''; and Whereas the United States was founded on the belief in the sanctity of the individual, to which the collectivistic system of socialism in all of its forms is fundamentally and necessarily opposed: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States. <all>",

    "full_text": "[Congressional Bills 119th Congress] [From the U.S. Government Publishing Office] [H.R. 5811 Introduced in House (IH)] <DOC> 119th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 5811 To promote the leadership of the United States in global innovation by establishing a robust patent system that restores and protects the right of inventors to own and enforce private property rights in inventions and discoveries, and for other purposes. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES October 24, 2025 Mr. Massie (for himself, Ms. Kaptur, Mr. Roy, Mr. Davidson, Mr. Cloud, and Mr. Gosar) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To promote the leadership of the United States in global innovation by establishing a robust patent system that restores and protects the right of inventors to own and enforce private property rights in inventions and discoveries, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Restoring America's Leadership in Innovation Act of 2025''. (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as follows: Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. Sec. 2. Findings. Sec. 3. Restoring the right of the first inventor to secure a patent. Sec. 4. Abolishing inter partes and post-grant review. Sec. 5. Abolishing the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Sec. 6. Elimination of fee diversion and full funding of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Sec. 7. Patentability of scientific discoveries and software inventions. Sec. 8. Limitations on prior art. Sec. 9. Restoring patents as a property right. Sec. 10. Ending automatic publication of patent applications. Sec. 11. Presumption of validity; defenses. Sec. 12. Injunction. Sec. 13. Best mode requirement. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The Congress created a patent system to ``promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries,'' as provided for in the Constitution of the United States. (2) The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Public Law 112-29) enacted on September 16, 2011, and several decisions of the Supreme Court have harmed the progress of Science and the useful Arts by eroding the strength and value of the patent system. (3) The United States Government exists to protect life, liberty, and property, which includes intellectual property. (4) A United States patent secures a private property right to an inventor. (5) This Act restores the patent system as envisioned by the Constitution of the United States. SEC. 3. RESTORING THE RIGHT OF THE FIRST INVENTOR TO SECURE A PATENT. (a) Repeal of First-to-File System Under the America Invents Act.-- Section 3 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Public Law 112-29), including each amendment made by such section, is repealed and any amendment made by such section to any provision shall be effective as if the provision had not been amended by such section. (b) First-to-Invent.--Notwithstanding any other provision under title 35, United States Code, a person shall be entitled to a patent where the inventor is first to conceive of the invention and diligently reduces the invention to practice. (c) One-Year Grace Period.--Notwithstanding any other provision under title 35, United States Code, a person shall be entitled to a one-year grace period before filing an application for a patent, as the grace period existed before the date of the enactment of the Leahy- Smith America Invents Act under section 102 of title 35, United States Code, and with the same meaning of the terms ``in public use'' and ``on sale in this country'' as interpreted before the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) reverting the United States patent system from a ``first-to-file'' system back to ``first-to-invent'' system will promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries and incentivize innovation and protect inventors' rights; (2) restoring the one-year grace period before the first and true inventor must file a patent application on an invention will promote the progress of science and useful arts by enabling inventors once again to disclose inventions in order to attract investment, complete research and development on the invention, test, improve, and perfect the invention so as to improve the invention and the quality of the patent application; and (3) the repeal of section 3, and the amendments made by section 3, of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, restore sections 100, 102, 103, 135, and 291 of title 35, United States Code, to the way such sections read on the day before the date of the enactment of such Act. SEC. 4. ABOLISHING INTER PARTES AND POST-GRANT REVIEW. (a) Repeal of Inter Partes and Post-Grant Review.--Section 6 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Public Law 112-29), including each amendment made by such section, is repealed and any amendment made by such section to any provision shall be effective as if the provision had not been amended by such section. (b) Repeal of Codified Titles.--Chapters 31 and 32 of title 35, United States Code, are repealed. (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings introduced by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act have harmed the progress of science and the useful arts by subjecting inventors to serial challenges to patents; (2) inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings invalidate patents at an unreasonably high rate; (3) patent rights should be protected from unfair adjudication at the Patent and Trademark Office and duly issued patents should be adjudicated in a judicial proceeding; (4) repealing section 6 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act abolishes inter partes review, post-grant review, and the previously available inter partes reexamination proceedings; and (5) it is the intent of Congress to preserve ex parte reexamination proceedings under chapter 30 of title 35, United States Code. SEC. 5. ABOLISHING THE PATENT TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD. (a) Repeal of Patent Trial and Appeal Board.--Section 7 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Public Law 112-29) is repealed, including each amendment made by such section, and any amendment made by such section to any provision shall be effective as if the provision had not been amended by such section. (b) Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.-- (1) Amendment.--Section 6 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: ``Sec. 6. Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ``(a) Establishment and Composition.--There shall be in the Patent and Trademark Office a Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences. The Director, the Deputy Director, the Commissioner for Patents, the Commissioner for Trademarks, and the administrative patent judges shall constitute the Board. The administrative patent judges shall be persons of competent legal knowledge and scientific ability who are appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Director. ``(b) Duties.--The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences shall, on written appeal of an applicant, review adverse decisions of examiners upon applications for patents and shall determine priority and patentability of invention in interferences declared under section 135(a). Each appeal and interference shall be heard by at least three members of the Board, who shall be designated by the Director. Only the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences may grant rehearings. The Board shall not invalidate an issued patent except in an ex parte reexamination under chapter 30. ``(c) Authority of the Secretary.--The Secretary of Commerce may, in the Secretary's discretion, deem the appointment of an administrative patent judge who, before the date of the enactment of this subsection, held office pursuant to an appointment by the Director, to take effect on the date on which the Director initially appointed the administrative patent judge. ``(d) Defense to Challenge of Appointment.--It shall be a defense to a challenge to the appointment of an administrative patent judge on the basis of the judge's having been originally appointed by the Director that the administrative patent judge so appointed was acting as a de facto officer.''. (2) Technical and conforming amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 1 of title 35, United States Code, is amended by striking the item relating to section 6 and inserting the following new item: ``6. Board of patent appeals and interferences.''. (c) Appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.-- (1) Amendment.--Section 134 of title 35, United States Code, as reinstated by section 3(a) of this Act, is amended by striking subsection (c). (2) Technical and conforming amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 12 of title 35, United States Code, is amended by striking the item relating to section 134 and inserting the following new item: ``134. Appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.''. (d) Appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.-- Section 141 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: ``Sec. 141. Appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ``(a) Examinations.--An applicant dissatisfied with the decision in an appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences under section 134 may appeal the decision directly to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or may seek review de novo in any district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction. ``(b) Reexaminations.--A patent owner who is, in a reexamination proceeding, dissatisfied with the final decision in an appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences under section 134 may appeal the decision directly to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or may seek review de novo in a district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction. ``(c) Interference.--A party to an interference dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on the interference may appeal the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but such appeal shall be dismissed if any adverse party to such interference, within twenty days after the appellant has filed notice of appeal in accordance with section 142, files notice with the Director that the party elects to have all further proceedings conducted as provided in section 146. If the appellant does not, within thirty days after filing of such notice by the adverse party, file a civil action under section 146, the decision appealed from shall govern the further proceedings in the case.''. (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the Patent Trial and Appeal Board shall be replaced with the former Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences; (2) with the abolishment of inter partes review and post- grant review proceedings, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board is no longer needed to conduct these duties; (3) unless otherwise in the context of an ex parte reexamination under chapter 30 of title 35, United States Code, the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences will not be used to invalidate an already issued patent; (4) the changes described in paragraphs (1) through (3) will protect the rights of patent owners who have been granted a patent and ensure a fair, fully adjudicated proceeding to invalidate an issued patent; (5) the amendment to section 6 of title 35, United States Code, reflects Congress's intent to require a judicial proceeding to invalidate an issued patent; and (6) the amendments to section 134 of title 35, United States Code, and section 141 of title 35, United States Code, are intended to restore each respective section to its prior state, but delete any reference to inter partes reexamination, which is no longer available. SEC. 6. ELIMINATION OF FEE DIVERSION AND FULL FUNDING OF THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE. (a) Patent and Trademark Office Funding.--Section 42 of title 35, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``(a) All fees'' and inserting ``(a) In General.--Fees''; (2) in subsection (b)-- (A) by striking ``(b) All fees'' and inserting ``(b) Credit of Fees.--Fees''; and (B) by striking ``Patent and Trademark Office Appropriation Account'' and inserting ``United States Patent and Trademark Office Innovation Promotion Fund''; (3) in subsection (c)-- (A) by striking ``(1) To the extent'' and all that follows through ``fees'' and inserting ``(c) Use of Fees.--(1) Fees''; (B) in paragraph (1), by striking ``shall be collected by and shall, subject to paragraph (3), be available to the Director'' and inserting ``shall be collected by the Director and shall be available to the Director until expended''; (C) by striking paragraph (2); and (D) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (2); (4) by redesignating subsections (d) and (e) as subsections (e) and (f), respectively; and (5) by inserting after subsection (c) the following: ``(d) Revolving Fund.-- ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection: ``(A) Fund.--The term `Fund' means the United States Patent and Trademark Office Innovation Promotion Fund established under paragraph (2). ``(B) Trademark act of 1946.--The term `Trademark Act of 1946' means the Act entitled `An Act to provide for the registration and protection of trademarks used in commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain international conventions, and for other purposes', approved July 5, 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.) (commonly referred to as the `Trademark Act of 1946' or the `Lanham Act'). ``(2) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury a revolving fund to be known as the `United States Patent and Trademark Office Innovation Promotion Fund'. ``(3) Derivation of resources.--There shall be deposited into the Fund any fees collected under-- ``(A) this title; or ``(B) the Trademark Act of 1946. ``(4) Expenses.--Amounts deposited into the Fund under paragraph (3) shall be available, without fiscal year limitation, to cover-- ``(A) all expenses to the extent consistent with the limitation on the use of fees set forth in subsection (c), including all administrative and operating expenses, determined in the discretion of the Director to be ordinary and reasonable, incurred by the Director for the continued operation of all services, programs, activities, and duties of the Office relating to patents and trademarks, as such services, programs, activities, and duties are described under-- ``(i) this title; and ``(ii) the Trademark Act of 1946; and ``(B) all expenses incurred pursuant to any obligation, representation, or other commitment of the Office.''; (6) in subsection (e), as so redesignated, by striking ``The Director'' and inserting ``Refunds.-- The Director''; and (7) in subsection (f), as so redesignated, by striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting ``Report.-- The Secretary''. (b) Effective Date; Transfer From and Termination of Obsolete Funds.-- (1) Effective date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall take effect on the first day of the first fiscal year that begins on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. (2) Remaining balances.--There shall be deposited in the Fund, on the effective date described in paragraph (1), any available unobligated balances remaining in the Patent and Trademark Office Appropriation Account, and in the Patent and Trademark Fee Reserve Fund established under section 42(c)(2) of title 35, United States Code, as in effect on the day before the effective date. (3) Termination of reserve fund.--Upon the payment of all obligated amounts in the Patent and Trademark Fee Reserve Fund under paragraph (2), the Patent and Trademark Fee Reserve Fund shall be terminated. SEC. 7. PATENTABILITY OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES AND SOFTWARE INVENTIONS. (a) Amendment.--Section 101 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: ``Sec. 101. Inventions patentable ``(a) In General.--Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title. ``(b) Exception.--A claimed invention is ineligible patent subject matter under subsection (a) if the claimed invention as a whole, as understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art, exists in nature independently of and prior to any human activity, or exists solely in the human mind. ``(c) Eligibility Standard.--The eligibility of a claimed invention under subsections (a) and (b) shall be determined without regard as to the requirements or conditions of sections 102, 103, and 112 of this title, or the claimed invention's inventive concept.''. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence concerning subject matter patentability has harmed the progress of science and the useful arts; (2) the United States patent system must protect and encourage research and development in such scientific disciplines as would promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries and provide scientists in the life sciences, computer sciences, and other disciplines, with certainty that their discoveries and inventions are entitled to patent protection; and (3) this amendment effectively abrogates Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 573 U.S. 208 (2014), Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593 (2010), Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, 569 U.S. 576 (2013), Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, 566 U.S. 66 (2012), and its predecessors to ensure that life sciences discoveries, computer software, and similar inventions and discoveries are patentable, and that those patents are enforceable. SEC. 8. LIMITATIONS ON PRIOR ART. Section 102 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: ``Sec. 102. Conditions for patentability; novelty ``(a) In General.--A person shall be entitled to a patent unless-- ``(1) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent; ``(2) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States; ``(3) he has abandoned the invention; ``(4) the invention was first patented or caused to be patented, or was the subject of an inventor's certificate, by the applicant or his legal representatives or assigns in a foreign country prior to the date of the application for patent in this country on an application for patent or inventor's certificate filed more than twelve months before the filing of the application in the United States; ``(5) the invention was described in (1) an application for patent, published under section 122(b), by another filed in the United States before the invention by the applicant for patent or (2) a patent granted on an application for patent by another filed in the United States before the invention by the applicant for patent, except that an international application filed under the treaty defined in section 351(a) shall have the effects for the purposes of this subsection of an application filed in the United States only if the international application designated the United States and was published under Article 21(2) of such treaty in the English language; ``(6) he did not himself invent the subject matter sought to be patented; or ``(7)(A) during the course of an interference conducted under section 135 or section 291, another inventor involved therein establishes, to the extent permitted in section 104, that before such person's invention thereof the invention was made by such other inventor and not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed; or ``(B) before such person's invention thereof, the invention was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it. In determining priority of invention under this subsection, there shall be considered not only the respective dates of conception and reduction to practice of the invention, but also the reasonable diligence of one who was first to conceive and last to reduce to practice, from a time prior to conception by the other. ``(b) Disclosures in Patent Applications and Patents.--A disclosure shall not be prior art to a claimed invention under this section if before the issuance of a patent-- ``(1) the information disclosed was obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor; ``(2) the information disclosed to the Office or another party during the one-year period prior to the date of the application for patent had, before a patent application for the information was effectively filed, been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor; or ``(3) the information disclosed and the claimed invention, not later than the effective filing date of the claimed invention, were owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person.''. SEC. 9. RESTORING PATENTS AS A PROPERTY RIGHT. (a) Private Property Patent Right.-- (1) Amendment.--Chapter 10 of title 35, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ``Sec. 106. Private property patent right ``A patent right is a private property right secured to an inventor upon issuance of the patent that shall only be revoked by a court ruling in a judicial proceeding, unless the patent owner consents to an administrative or other procedure.''. (2) Technical and conforming amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 10 of title 35, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new item: ``106. Private property patent right.''. (b) Ownership; Assignment.--Section 261 of title 35, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``patents shall have the attributes of personal property'' and inserting the following: ``patents shall be recognized as private property rights''; and (2) by inserting after the second sentence the following: ``As private property rights, applications for patents, patents, and interests therein shall be freely transferrable, in whole or in part, including conveyance by assignment or license. Any successors, heirs, assigns, or licensees of a patent owner, who receive a lesser interest in a patent, shall be subject to any and all restrictions of their interest in the patent, provided that the successors, heirs, assigns, or licensees have actual or constructive notice of such restrictions.''. (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) recent jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, including Oil States Energy Services v. Greene's Energy Group, 138 S. Ct. 1365 (2018), have harmed the progress of science and the useful arts by unconstitutionally changing the treatment of fundamental patent rights to government-bestowed public franchises from the Founders' original intent of exclusive private property rights of limited duration; (2) recent jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, including Impression Products Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc., have harmed the progress of science and the useful arts by limiting the ability of patent owners to exclude unlicensed customers from their supply chains; and (3) meaningful patent rights must permit patent owners to freely assign their rights in whole, or in part, and to ensure that successors, heirs, or assigns of a patent owner, or their assigns, are duly bound by restrictions or exclusions set by patent owners on the use of their property. SEC. 10. ENDING AUTOMATIC PUBLICATION OF PATENT APPLICATIONS. (a) Amendment.--Section 122(b) of title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: ``(b) Publication.-- ``(1) In general.--Each application for a patent shall be published, in accordance with procedures determined by the Director, only upon the request of the patent applicant. ``(2) Information released once a patent issues.--No information concerning a patent application shall be available to the public unless and until a patent issues.''. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) automatic publication of patent applications after 18 months has harmed the progress of science and the useful arts by creating ``prior art'' by operation of law that prevents a patent owner from applying for a patent on the same invention if a patent does not issue; and (2) automatic publication of patent applications encourages early disclosure of claimed inventions and subjects innovative inventions and discoveries reduced to practice in the United States to theft or appropriation by foreign competitors. SEC. 11. PRESUMPTION OF VALIDITY; DEFENSES. (a) Validity of a Patent in Adjudicatory Proceedings.--Section 282(a) of title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: ``(a) In General.-- ``(1) Presumption of validity for a patent.--In any judicial or administrative proceeding conducted in any court or Federal agency (as defined in section 201) or of any State, a patent issued under this title shall be presumed valid. ``(2) Presumption of validity for claims of a patent.--In any proceeding described under paragraph (1)-- ``(A) each claim of a patent (whether in independent, dependent, or multiple dependent form) shall be presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims; and ``(B) dependent or multiple dependent claims shall be presumed valid even though dependent upon an invalid claim. ``(3) Burden of establishing invalidity.--In any proceeding described under paragraph (1) in which the validity of a patent is at issue, the burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof rests on the party asserting the invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.''. (b) Tolling Patent Term During Judicial Challenge.--Section 282 of title 35, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(d) Tolling of Patent Term During Validity Challenge.--In an action involving a patent where the validity of the patent has been challenged, the patent term shall be tolled from the time the validity of the patent is challenged to the time of resolution of the validity issue by the court. The patent term shall resume once the validity challenge is resolved. The court may award damages to the patent owner in a case in which another party brought a validity claim against the patent in bad faith.''. SEC. 12. INJUNCTION. (a) Amendment.--Section 283 of title 35, United States Code, is amended-- (1) by striking ``The'' and inserting the following: ``(a) In General.--The''; and (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection: ``(b) Permanent Injunction.-- ``(1) In general.--Upon a finding of infringement of a patent, the court shall presume that further infringement of the patent would cause the patent owner irreparable harm. This presumption may be overcome only by a showing of clear and convincing evidence by the infringing party that the patent owner would not be irreparably harmed by further infringement of the patent. The patent owner is not required to make or sell a product covered by the patent to show irreparable harm. ``(2) Patent owner defined.--In this subsection, a `patent owner' means the owner of the patent or an exclusive licensee of the patent.''. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that this section abrogates the Supreme Court's ruling in and subsequent lower court interpretations of eBay v. MercExchange, 547 U.S. 388 (2006), which has been applied as a de facto presumption against granting patent owners injunctive relief. SEC. 13. BEST MODE REQUIREMENT. Section 15 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Public Law 112- 29), including each amendment made by such section, is repealed and any provision amended by such section shall be amended to read as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of such Act. <all>",

R. 5812 To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to cap certain intercollegiate athletics compensation and buyouts as a condition of institutional participation in Federal student aid programs, and for other purposes. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES October 24, 2025 Mr. Baumgartner introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Education and Workforce _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to cap certain intercollegiate athletics compensation and buyouts as a condition of institutional participation in Federal student aid programs, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Correcting Opportunity and Accountability in Collegiate Hiring Act (COACH Act)''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (a) Intercollegiate athletics, when properly governed, promote student development and broad-based participation aligned with educational missions. (b) Institutions participating in programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) receive substantial Federal support and tax advantages, creating a heightened obligation to manage athletics in service of educational priorities and equal opportunity. (c) Escalating compensation and buyouts for athletics personnel can divert resources from academic priorities and broad-based opportunities, including women's and Olympic sports, and warrant reasonable, uniform guardrails as a condition of title IV participation. (d) Federal courts have held that the National Collegiate Athletic Association's caps on coaches' pay violate antitrust laws--e.g., Law v. NCAA (10th Cir. 1998) permanently enjoining the NCAA's ``restricted- earnings coach'' salary cap rule--and have continued to scrutinize coach-compensation restraints (including rules setting compensation to zero); therefore, any statutory cap must be accompanied by a targeted antitrust safe harbor to permit collective implementation and enforcement. SEC. 3. PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS. Section 487(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1094(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(30) Limitations on intercollegiate athletics compensation and buyouts.-- ``(A) Compensation cap.--As a condition of eligibility under this title, the institution shall ensure that the total annual compensation paid, promised, or provided to any athletics department employee does not exceed 10 times the institution's tuition and required fees for a first-time, full-time undergraduate for the most recent academic year. ``(B) Buyouts and separation payments.--Any payment to terminate, buy out, or settle an employment agreement with an athletics department employee shall be treated as compensation for purposes of subparagraph (A) in the year paid, and may not cause the cap in subparagraph (A) to be exceeded. ``(C) Conference and affiliate coverage.--The institution shall ensure compliance with this paragraph for any agreement entered by an athletics conference, media-rights consortium, collective, foundation, or other affiliate that allocates, assigns, or provides compensation or buyouts to the institution's athletics department employees. ``(D) Certification and disclosure.--The Secretary shall require annual program participation agreement certification that the institution and its affiliates are in compliance with this paragraph and shall require public disclosure of the cap amount for the year and the tuition and required fees figure used to calculate it and the number of covered employees whose total annual compensation is within 10 percent of the cap. ``(E) Transition.-- ``(i) Written employment agreements executed before the date of this Act may continue for their remaining original term (excluding extensions or renewals), provided that the agreement and scheduled payments are disclosed under subparagraph (D); and no amendment increases compensation above amounts stated in the agreement as of the date of this Act. ``(ii) Prospective compliance.--Agreements executed on or after the date of this Act shall comply with this paragraph. ``(F) Definitions.--In this paragraph, the term: ``(i) Athletics department employee--means any employee of the institution (or of a related organization acting for the institution) whose primary duties relate to intercollegiate athletics, including head and assistant coaches, the director of athletics, associate or assistant athletic directors, and senior athletics administrators. ``(ii) Tuition and required fees--means the published undergraduate tuition and required fees for a first-time, full-time undergraduate student at the institution, as reported to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System pursuant to section 487(a)(17) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1094(a)(17)). For public institutions with differential resident and nonresident rates, the in-state figure applies. ``(iii) Athletics conference--means a voluntary association of institutions of higher education formed to organize, regulate, or commercialize intercollegiate varsity athletics competition, including any media-rights or data-rights affiliate. ``(iv) `Total annual compensation'--means wages, salaries, stipends, allowances, incentive or performance bonuses, signing or retention bonuses, deferred compensation, employer retirement contributions above standard plan matches, severance, buyouts, cancellation or mitigation payments, in-kind compensation, appearance fees, debt servicing, debt relief, and any other compensation paid by or through a related organization (including a foundation, booster organization, media arm, or affiliate) or a third party under an arrangement to perform services for the institution.''. SEC. 4. LIABILITY LIMITATION. (a) In General.--Adoption of, agreement to, compliance with, or enforcement of any rule, regulation, requirement, standard, or other provision established pursuant to, or in compliance with, section 3 of this Act shall be treated as lawful under the antitrust laws and any similar State provision having the force and effect of law. (b) Antitrust Laws.--The term ``antitrust laws'' in sub-paragraph (a) has the meaning given such term in the 1st section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12) and includes section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent that such section 5 applies to unfair methods of competition. <all>",

R. 5828 To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry out a public awareness campaign to increase awareness of the importance of father inclusion and engagement in improving overall health outcomes during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum, and for other purposes. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES October 24, 2025 Mr. Vindman (for himself and Mr. Ciscomani) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry out a public awareness campaign to increase awareness of the importance of father inclusion and engagement in improving overall health outcomes during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Dads Matter Act of 2025''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Father engagement can play an important role in improving maternal health care, addressing maternal mortality and morbidity, and bettering the development and long-term growth of the child. (2) The participation of fathers during prenatal care appointments provides the mother with additional support to recognize potential pregnancy-related complications that could lead to maternal mortality and morbidity. (3) When fathers are involved during pregnancy appointments and milestones, mothers are 1.5 times more likely to receive prenatal care in the first trimester, which improves health outcomes for both the mother and baby. (4) Father support during pregnancy can help promote behavioral health of the mother. (5) Father engagement reduces the risks of postpartum mood and anxiety disorders and contributes to a lower likelihood of preterm birth and a healthier birthweight. (6) Including fathers in conversations about safe sleep guidelines and sharing guidance about infant crying and the risks of shaken baby syndrome can help reduce infant deaths. (7) Active support of the father during breastfeeding greatly increases the chances of successful breastfeeding, which improves the physical and mental health of the baby and the mother. (8) Physical contact between the father and the baby just after birth and in the months following birth has been shown to improve the health and development of the baby, improve the mental health of the father, and foster father-child bonding in the short-term and long-term. SEC. 3. INCREASING AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FATHER INCLUSION AND ENGAGEMENT IN THE PREGNANCY, BIRTH, AND POSTPARTUM PROCESS. (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall carry out a public awareness campaign to increase understanding of the importance of father inclusion and engagement in improving overall health outcomes during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum, for both the mother and baby. (b) Requirements.--The campaign under subsection (a) shall include-- (1) messaging intended to provide information to the public about the importance of a father's role in pregnancy and parenting; (2) resources and information to counter popular narratives that minimize the importance of engaged and involved fathers in pregnancy and parenting; and (3) resources and information that promote awareness about the impact of father inclusion on maternal and infant outcomes, including-- (A) the importance of father-to-infant, skin-to- skin contact in improving the health and development of a newborn and fostering father-child bonding in the short- and long-term; (B) the role of fathers in promoting the behavioral health of the mother; (C) the role of fathers in increasing the number of prenatal and postpartum appointments a mother attends; (D) the effects of father attendance during prenatal and postnatal appointments; (E) the effects of paternal postpartum depression; (F) the role of father support in improving rates of successful breastfeeding; and (G) the role of father involvement in providing the mother with additional support to recognize potential pregnancy-related complications, which could include-- (i) preeclampsia; (ii) peripartum cardiomyopathy; (iii) preterm labor; (iv) perinatal mood and anxiety disorders; (v) pregnancy loss or miscarriage; (vi) stillbirth; (vii) high blood pressure; (viii) cervical infections; (ix) gestational diabetes; (x) placental abruption; (xi) ectopic pregnancy; and (xii) uterine rupture. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE TO STATES ON ENCOURAGING FATHER INCLUSION AND ENGAGEMENT IN THE PREGNANCY, BIRTH, AND POSTPARTUM PROCESS. (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue guidance to States that addresses how States can encourage and incentivize providers of maternity care, including hospitals, health care systems, midwifery practices, freestanding birth centers, community health centers, and other maternity care providers, and providers of health care coverage, including managed care entities, to provide training and education to health care practitioners, such as pediatricians, obstetricians, and gynecologists, about the benefits of including and engaging fathers in the pregnancy, birth, and postpartum process. (b) Requirements.--The guidance under subsection (a) shall-- (1) include information on how health care practitioners can-- (A) offer peer-to-peer, father-to-father encouragement, support, and education in communities that traditionally are not inclusive of fathers; (B) provide fathers with information on-- (i) what to expect before, during, and after the birth process; (ii) how to better-- (I) understand and support their partner throughout such process; and (II) serve as an advocate in her care; and (iii) recommendations and protocol relating to pregnancy, postpartum, and child care, including-- (I) maternal, infant, and routine childhood vaccines; (II) maternal warning signs; (III) the importance of fetal movement counting; (IV) maternal mental health and postpartum recovery; (V) breastfeeding practices; (VI) health care appointments; (VII) safe sleep practices; (VIII) skin-to-skin contact; (IX) baby care, including safe soothing of a crying baby; (X) child bonding; and (XI) early childhood development; and (C) screen fathers for depression and provide referrals for treatment that may positively impact child development and reduce the risk of adverse childhood experiences; (2) address cultural beliefs about fatherhood, a man's role in maternal health, and families; and (3) reaffirm a father's ability to play a positive and valuable role during pregnancy, birth, and early childhood development, regardless of race or ethnicity. SEC. 5. GAO STUDY AND REPORT. Not later than 6 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct, and submit to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, a report describing the results of, a study on the effectiveness of this Act. <all>",

    "full_text": "[Congressional Bills 119th Congress] [From the U.S. Government Publishing Office] [H.R. 5830 Introduced in House (IH)] <DOC> 119th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 5830 To establish a pilot program providing certain individuals with a guaranteed monthly income, to study the effect of a guaranteed monthly income on such individuals, and for other purposes. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES October 24, 2025 Mrs. Watson Coleman (for herself, Mrs. McIver, Ms. Tlaib, Mr. Davis of Illinois, Ms. Norton, Ms. Schakowsky, Ms. Jacobs, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, Mr. Thanedar, Mr. Mullin, Ms. Lee of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Torres of New York) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To establish a pilot program providing certain individuals with a guaranteed monthly income, to study the effect of a guaranteed monthly income on such individuals, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Guaranteed Income Pilot Program Act of 2025''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Too many Americans cannot achieve financial stability due to income volatility, the rising cost of living, wage stagnation, and a lack of affordable housing. (2) Real wages have failed to keep pace with inflation, meaning the purchasing power of American households has not changed in decades. (3) Income volatility, defined as an annual income fluctuation of 25 percent or more, impacts millions of American households. (4) Two-thirds of Americans are worried they wouldn't be able to cover their living expenses for just 1 month if they lose their primary source of income, while 57 percent of American adults are currently unable to cover a $1,000 emergency expense. That percentage is higher for millennials at 79 percent, and Generation Z at 85 percent, unable to cover an emergency expense. (5) Full-time minimum wage earners cannot afford an average 2-bedroom apartment anywhere in the United States. (6) The changing nature of the economy, including the rise of the gig economy, unemployment risks posed by automation, and the fluctuating nature of waged labor, will result in increased income volatility and prohibit upward economic mobility. (7) During the height of COVID-19, the Federal Government provided stimulus checks to the American people in response to the economic hardship of the pandemic. The Census Bureau complied an analysis that showed that material hardship in United States households fell sharply following the passage of the COVID-19 relief bill in late December 2020, and the American Rescue Plan in March 2021. From December 2020 to April 2021, food insufficiently fell by over 40 percent, financial instability fell by 45 percent, and reported adverse mental health symptoms fell by 20 percent. SEC. 3. GUARANTEED INCOME PILOT PROGRAM. (a) In General.--The Secretary, in consultation with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, shall establish and implement a 3- year pilot program (hereinafter referred to as the ``program'') to provide a guaranteed monthly income to certain eligible individuals in accordance with this section. (b) Income Subsidy.-- (1) Selection of participating eligible individuals.--The Secretary, in consultation with the Commissioner and the external partner selected pursuant to subsection (d), shall develop selection criteria that the Secretary will use to select 20,000 total eligible individuals for participation in the program. (2) Amount of income subsidy.--Of the eligible individuals participating in the program, 10,000 shall receive a cash payment each month equal to the fair market rent for a 2- bedroom home in the ZIP Code in which the eligible individual resides, or a substantially similar amount as determined by the Secretary, in consultation with the Commissioner and the external partner. (3) Monthly distribution of income subsidy.--Each participating eligible individual shall receive the cash payment on the 15th day of each month. (c) Responsibilities of Commissioner of Internal Revenue.--The Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall be responsible for-- (1) providing the Secretary access to tax records to administer and study the program under this section; and (2) updating the Secretary and the external partner on changes to the taxable income of a participating eligible individual. (d) External Partner.-- (1) Selection.--The Secretary shall select an external partner to provide assistance with the design, administration, and evaluation of the program. (2) Qualifications.--An organization selected to be the external partner shall have demonstrated experience in-- (A) mixed-methods experimental design; and (B) implementing cash-transfer programs. (3) Confidentiality.--The external partner, and any employee of the external partner, shall be treated as a Federal employee for purposes of section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. (4) Data collection.--The external partner shall collect data from participating eligible individuals as necessary to complete the study and reports required under section 4, and to conduct any additional research as the Secretary determines necessary. (e) Disregard of Cash Payments for Purposes of All Federal and Federally Assisted Programs.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any payment made to participating eligible individuals under this section shall not be taken into account as income, and shall not be taken into account as resources for a period of 12 months from receipt, for purposes of determining the eligibility of such eligible individual (or any other individual) for benefits or assistance (or the amount or extent of benefits or assistance) under any Federal program or any State or local program financed in whole or in part with Federal funds. SEC. 4. STUDY AND REPORT. (a) Study on Pilot Program.--The Secretary, in collaboration with the Commissioner and the external partner, shall conduct a study on outcomes of the program. (b) Interim Report.--Not later than 24 months after participating eligible individuals have been begun participating in the program, the Secretary, in consultation with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the external partner, shall provide an interim report on the program under section 3 to the Congress. (c) Final Report.--Not later than 12 months after the conclusion of the program under section 3, the Secretary, in consultation with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the external partner, shall provide a final report on the program to the Congress, including-- (1) an analysis of-- (A) the effect of the monthly income subsidy provided in section 3 on-- (i) micro-economic outcomes of participating eligible individuals; (ii) the health of participating eligible individuals; and (iii) the social costs of income volatility, including connections with income fluctuation and health, housing, education, employment, childcare, and other outcomes as determined appropriate by the Secretary; and (B) the feasibility of expanding the program under section 3 to include a larger number of participants; and (2) the results of interviews and focus groups conducted with consenting participants of the program. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act: (1) Commissioner.--The term ``Commissioner'' means the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. (2) Eligible individual.--The term ``eligible individual'' means an individual taxpayer between the ages of 18-65. (3) External partner.--The term ``external partner'' means a non-partisan research agency or a non-profit academic institution with expertise in social science experimentation.

RES. 827 Expressing support for the recognition of October 26, 2025, as Intersex Awareness Day, and supporting the goals and ideals of Intersex Awareness Day. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES October 24, 2025 Ms. Balint (for herself, Mr. Takano, Mr. Pocan, Ms. Bonamici, Mrs. Foushee, Mr. Frost, Mr. Mullin, Mr. Peters, Ms. Tlaib, Ms. Norton, Mr. Torres of New York, Mrs. Watson Coleman, Ms. Jayapal, Mrs. Ramirez, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, Mr. Carson, Ms. Garcia of Texas, Ms. Jacobs, Mr. Evans of Pennsylvania, Ms. Randall, and Mr. Huffman) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Education and Workforce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned _______________________________________________________________________ RESOLUTION Expressing support for the recognition of October 26, 2025, as Intersex Awareness Day, and supporting the goals and ideals of Intersex Awareness Day. Whereas Intersex Awareness Day honors the first public demonstration by intersex people in the United States, which took place at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics on October 26, 1996; Whereas, since that historic demonstration in 1996, October 26 has become a day during which intersex people and allies come together to celebrate and uplift the intersex community; Whereas ``intersex'' refers to individuals with innate variations in their physical sex characteristics, including external anatomy, reproductive organs, hormonal function, or chromosomal patterns that differ from stereotypes about male or female bodies; Whereas being intersex is not the same thing as being transgender, but both transgender and intersex people hold shared interests in bodily autonomy, self-determination, and the recognition of their existence and rights; Whereas policies, orders, and governmental actions that espouse an unscientific definition of biological sex as a rigid binary erase and demean the existence of people with intersex variations; Whereas intersex is not generally considered to be a ``third sex'', but rather represents the wide range of biological variation observed in bodily development, with over 40 different intersex traits having been discovered; Whereas the most widely cited estimate of the frequency of intersex traits in the population is 1.7 percent, yet the true prevalence is likely higher; Whereas the rights, health, and well-being of intersex people are undermined by erasure and by patterns of stigmatization and discrimination on the basis of variations in sex characteristics, intersex status, and perceived gender nonconformity; Whereas babies and young children with intersex variations are often subjected, without their own informed consent or assent, to irreversible genital surgeries, sterilizations, and other interventions to make their bodies conform to stereotypical expectations of what it means to appear, behave as, or be male or female, most commonly before the age of two; Whereas it is exceedingly rare that a child's intersex variation would necessitate surgery on an urgent basis in infancy or early childhood, and decisions about such surgeries could therefore be safely postponed in the vast majority of cases until such time as the child becomes able to provide informed consent or assent, or such time as a medically urgent indication for surgery may otherwise arise; Whereas there is evidence that performing these irreversible surgeries in infancy and early childhood in the absence of the intersex individual's consent can result in severe lasting physical and psychological harm, including loss of bodily function, the destruction of reproductive capacity, and the imposition of a sex assignment with which the individual will not identify, leading many intersex advocates to describe these nonconsensual surgeries as Intersex Genital Mutilation (IGM); Whereas 3 former Surgeons General of the United States have agreed that such early, nonconsensual surgeries on intersex children can cause ``severe and irreversible physical harm and emotional distress'' and ``violate an individual's right to personal autonomy over their own future'', ``clearly infring[ing] on the child's right to physical integrity, preservation of sexual and gender identity, and procreative freedom''; Whereas the Department of State has commemorated Intersex Awareness Day by recognizing the harm of these nonconsensual surgeries, stating that ``at a young age, intersex persons routinely face forced medical surgeries without free or informed consent. These interventions jeopardize their physical integrity and ability to live freely''; Whereas the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) ``opposes medically unnecessary genital surgeries performed on intersex children'' and states that ``Genital surgeries should only be recommended as medically necessary for intersex infants and children for the purpose of resolving significant functional impairment or reducing imminent and substantial risk of developing a health- or life-threatening condition''; Whereas the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, in its Standards of Care Version 8, recommends that providers treating intersex infants and young children delay ``genital surgery, gonadal surgery, or both, so as to optimize the children's self-determination and ability to participate in the decision based on informed consent''; Whereas the American Bar Association in a 2023 resolution took a position ``Oppos[ing] all . . . policy that attempts to impose medical or surgical intervention on minors with intersex traits (also known as variations in sex characteristics) without the minor's informed consent or assent, and urg[ing] licensed professionals not to conduct or propose medical or surgical intervention on minors with intersex traits until the minor requests the proposed care, understands the impact of the proposed care as well as alternatives, is provided with affirming psychosocial supports, and gives informed consent or assent, except when immediate life-threatening circumstances require emergency intervention''; Whereas the Presidential Memorandum of February 4, 2021, on ``Advancing the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Persons Around the World'' makes it ``the policy of the United States to pursue an end to violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics''; Whereas President Biden convened the first White House Roundtable on intersex issues on October 26, 2021, in celebration of Intersex Awareness Day, declaring that the administration ``is committed to advancing justice, opportunity, and safety for intersex Americans''; Whereas Executive Order 14075 of June 15, 2022, states that it is the policy of the United States Government ``to combat unlawful discrimination and eliminate disparities'' affecting ``lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) Americans'', including discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics; Whereas, in 2024, the Biden-Harris administration released their final rules on ``Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities'' and ``Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance'', explicitly clarifying that section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, respectively, prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics (including intersex traits); Whereas, on April 4, 2024, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a landmark resolution entitled ``Combating discrimination, violence and harmful practices against intersex persons'' with 24 countries, including the United States, voting in favor; Whereas, in January 2025, the Department of Health and Human Services released the first in-depth report on intersex health by a United States Federal agency, recognizing the ``well-documented medical harms to intersex people across their lifespan resulting from childhood medical interventions performed when the child was too young to participate in decision-making'', and concluding that this denial of bodily autonomy, in addition to discrimination and lack of access to competent and affirming medical providers, is a key barrier that must be addressed to achieve health equity for the intersex community; Whereas recent legislative proposals and agency actions attacking health care for transgender youth have simultaneously harmed intersex people, incorrectly labeling necessary gender-affirming medical care as ``mutilation'' while routinely exempting the actual nonconsensual mutilation of young intersex children from scrutiny; Whereas medical practices should respect the human rights and bodily autonomy of all people, and government institutions should implement policies that protect and support intersex people; Whereas the House of Representatives has voted twice to explicitly codify nondiscrimination protections for people with intersex variations in its passage of the Equality Act, and various Federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, have recognized that, consistent with the legal reasoning of Bostock v. Clayton County, discrimination on the basis of a person's sex characteristics is prohibited sex discrimination; and Whereas intersex people are an important part of the diversity of the Nation to be celebrated and should be afforded respect, dignity, and the universal human right to bodily autonomy: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) supports the goals and ideals of Intersex Awareness Day; (2) encourages the Federal Government, States, localities, nonprofit organizations, schools, and community organizations to observe the day with appropriate programs and activities, with the goal of increasing public knowledge of the intersex community and empowering individuals to celebrate and respect their diversity; (3) encourages health care providers to offer culturally and clinically competent care to the intersex community that respects bodily autonomy and self-determination, and encourages schools to support education regarding the intersex community and connect individuals to resources for young people with intersex variations and their families; and (4) encourages the Federal Government, States, international funding organizations, and United States bilateral and multilateral aid efforts to prioritize the health and human rights of intersex people. <all>",

Whereas more than 2,000,000 individuals serve as members of the Armed Forces of the United States, including the reserve components of the Armed Forces; Whereas several hundred thousand members of the Armed Forces are currently serving overseas in every region of the world; Whereas more than 2,000,000 members of the Armed Forces have deployed to the area of operations of the United States Central Command since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; Whereas, in the decades following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, members of the Armed Forces deployed in 2 major conflicts and countless operations throughout the world, and their service and bravery helped protect the United States from further terrorist attacks; Whereas the United States is kept strong and free by the loyal military personnel from the total force of the Armed Forces, which includes the active duty components and the reserve components, who protect the precious heritage of the United States through their declarations and actions; Whereas members of the Armed Forces have deployed to the Middle East to defend United States security interests, deter aggression, prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and promote stability in the region; Whereas members of the Armed Forces serving at home and abroad have courageously answered the call of duty to defend the ideals of the United States and to preserve peace and freedom around the world; Whereas members of the Armed Forces are called upon to respond to an increasingly complex and wide-ranging set of global threats to the United States; Whereas the courage, professionalism, and sacrifice of these deployed forces represent the highest traditions of the United States military; Whereas the United States remains committed to easing the transition from deployment abroad to service at home for members of the Armed Forces and their families; Whereas members of the Armed Forces personify the virtues of patriotism, dedication, courage, and steadfast service; Whereas the families of members of the Armed Forces make important and significant sacrifices for the United States; and Whereas the Senate has designated October 26 as the ``Day of the Deployed'' since 2011: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) expresses support for a ``Day of the Deployed''; (2) honors the deployed members of the Armed Forces of the United States and their families; (3) calls on the people of the United States to reflect on the service of those members of the Armed Forces, wherever the members serve, past, present, and future; and (4) encourages the people of the United States to observe the ``Day of the Deployed'' with appropriate ceremonies and activities. <all>",

    "full_text": "[Congressional Bills 119th Congress] [From the U.S. Government Publishing Office] [H. Res. 829 Introduced in House (IH)] <DOC> 119th CONGRESS 1st Session H. RES. 829 Recognizing the significance of equal pay and the pay disparity between disabled women and both disabled and nondisabled men. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES October 24, 2025 Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick (for herself, Ms. Pressley, Ms. Norton, and Ms. Simon) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Education and Workforce _______________________________________________________________________ RESOLUTION Recognizing the significance of equal pay and the pay disparity between disabled women and both disabled and nondisabled men. Whereas, more than 60 years after Congress enacted the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206 note; Public Law 88-38), an analysis of 2023 data from the Bureau of the Census shows that disabled women workers overall are paid an average of 56 cents for every dollar paid to nondisabled men, and among full-time, year-round workers this figure is 68 cents; Whereas an analysis of 2023 data from the Bureau of the Census shows that among full-time, year round workers-- (1) for every dollar paid to White, non-Hispanic, nondisabled men-- G (A) disabled Asian American and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women are paid 71 cents; G (B) disabled White, non-Hispanic women are paid 64 cents; G (C) disabled Black women are paid 60 cents; G (D) disabled American Indian and Alaska Native women are paid 54 cents; and G (E) disabled Latinas are paid 57 cents; (2) disabled women are paid an average of 81 cents for every dollar paid to disabled men; (3) disabled women overall, including part-time and part-year workers, are paid an average of 78 cents for every dollar paid to disabled men; and (4) while disabled people overall experience a wage gap, disabled women, particularly disabled women of color, experience a more significant wage gap; Whereas, of the 6 types of disability assessed in the American Community Survey-- (1) disabled women workers with each type of disability face a wage gap, as compared to nondisabled men; and (2) disabled women workers who have difficulty living independently have the largest wage gap, and are paid just 36 cents for every dollar paid to nondisabled men workers in 2022 among all workers; Whereas disabled women veterans are paid an average of 62 cents for every dollar paid to nondisabled veteran men in 2022 among all workers; Whereas the wage gap remains large for disabled women with more education, as disabled women workers with 4 years of college education working full- time, year-round in 2023 are typically paid $55,000 per year, which is less than nondisabled men workers with some college but no degree; Whereas disabled women experience occupational segregation and are overrepresented in low-paid health care, clerical, and social service jobs; Whereas, of disabled workers who live in institutional group quarters, disabled women workers are paid an average of just $9,000 per year and disabled men workers are paid $11,000 per year, while nondisabled men overall are typically paid an average of $50,000 per year in 2022 among all workers; Whereas segregated workplaces and the subminimum wage for disabled employees stifle competitive, integrated employment for disabled women; Whereas many systemic barriers affect access to livable wages and employment opportunities for disabled women, including-- (1) discrimination; (2) public benefits work disincentives; (3) a broken health care infrastructure; (4) increased employment-related costs; (5) inadequate vocational rehabilitation services; and (6) a lack of access to supported employment services; and Whereas LGBTQI+ disabled people face additional barriers to employment, and more inclusive data on LGBTQI+ disabled workers are needed to determine the added impact of these barriers on wages and workforce participation, particularly for trans and nonbinary disabled people who are often excluded from data: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) recognizes the pay disparity between disabled women and both disabled and nondisabled men and the impact of that pay disparity on women, families, and the United States; and (2) reaffirms its commitment to supporting equal pay for disabled women, narrowing the gender, disability, and racial wage gaps, and addressing the systemic barriers that drive inequities. <all>",

Whereas 1 in 700, or around 6,000, babies are born with Down syndrome in the United States every year, and each person with Down syndrome is an important member of our society; Whereas life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has increased dramatically in recent decades, from 25 years of age in 1983, to 60 years of age in 2025; Whereas people with Down syndrome attend school and work, participate in decisions that affect their livelihood, have meaningful relationships, vote, and contribute to society in many ways; Whereas recent studies have shown that employees with disabilities, including Down syndrome, are loyal, dedicated, and productive workers; Whereas, along with the care from their families, loved ones, and caregivers, research and advocacy for positive policy changes can improve the quality of life for members of the Down syndrome community; Whereas, since 1984, Congress has been committed to increasing Federal funding for Down syndrome research and improving the quality of life for people with Down syndrome and their families; Whereas the National Institutes of Health reports that Federal investment in Down syndrome research has increased from $18,000,000 in fiscal year 2014 to $133,000,000 in fiscal year 2023; Whereas, in unison with increased funding from Congress, the National Institutes of Health has redoubled its effort in biomedical and Down syndrome research, especially through the INCLUDE initiative, which is advancing science on the underlying cause of Alzheimer's disease among people with Down syndrome; Whereas organizations in the nonprofit sector continue to advocate for Federal research, drive policy changes, educate the American public, create guidebooks for caregivers, and offer platforms to self-advocates who want to share their personal experiences with others about Down syndrome; and Whereas people with Down syndrome, their families, Congress, and advocates remain focused on developing policies to ensure people with Down syndrome have every opportunity to live full and productive lives: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) expresses support for the designation of ``National Down Syndrome Awareness Month''; (2) believes ``National Down Syndrome Awareness Month'' is an opportunity to celebrate people with Down syndrome and their families as they continue to advocate for access and opportunity to live fully included lives; (3) commends people with Down syndrome, their families, medical researchers, doctors, scientists, and organizations who are the driving force behind improving the quality of life for people with Down syndrome; and (4) reiterates its commitment to ensuring Federal investment into Down syndrome research and pursuing policies to better support the Down syndrome community. <all>",

    "full_text": "[Congressional Bills 119th Congress] [From the U.S. Government Publishing Office] [H. Res. 833 Introduced in House (IH)] <DOC> 119th CONGRESS 1st Session H. RES. 833 Honoring the extraordinary life, leadership, and legacy of Dr. Jane Goodall. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES October 24, 2025 Mr. Quigley (for himself, Ms. Brownley, Mr. Carson, Mr. Deluzio, Ms. Norton, Mr. Huffman, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, Mr. Krishnamoorthi, Mr. Pocan, Ms. Schakowsky, Ms. Titus, Ms. Tokuda, Mr. Cohen, Ms. DelBene, Ms. Friedman, and Mr. Evans of Pennsylvania) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs _______________________________________________________________________ RESOLUTION Honoring the extraordinary life, leadership, and legacy of Dr. Jane Goodall. Whereas Dr. Jane Goodall, born in Hampstead, London, on April 3, 1934, became one of the world's most celebrated ethologists, animal behaviorists, naturalists, environmental conservationists, mentors, and humanists; Whereas, throughout her life, Jane Goodall remained an indefatigable advocate for wildlife, dedicating herself not only to the protection of chimpanzees and other primates, but also to broader efforts to safeguard the natural world; Whereas Jane Goodall's work extended far beyond science, inspiring generations through her books, films, lectures, and the Jane Goodall Institute and the Roots and Shoots Program which encourages youth around the world to work to make the world a better place for people, animals, and the environment; Whereas, in 1957, at the age of just 23, Jane Goodall moved to Africa on her own, where she met the famed paleontologist, Louis Leakey, and with his support and encouragement, she began the work that would define her life; Whereas, in 1960, she traveled to the Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve in Tanzania, accompanied by her mother Vanne, to begin her groundbreaking study of wild chimpanzees where she established what has become the world's longest-running wild chimpanzee research program, one that continues uninterrupted to this day; Whereas, even without formal academic training at the time, Jane Goodall's observations challenged prevailing scientific assumptions, she documented chimpanzees making and using tools, hunting, and displaying complex social behaviors, and activities that had once been thought exclusive to humans and these findings not only transformed the study of primatology, but also reshaped how the world viewed the emotional and social lives of all animals; Whereas recognizing the importance of formal study, Jane Goodall enrolled at Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1962, earning a degree in Natural Sciences and went on to pursue a doctorate at Darwin College, Cambridge, completing her Doctor of Philosophy in 1966 with a thesis on the behavior of free-living chimpanzees; Whereas Jane Goodall's early years of research at Gombe became the foundation of a scientific legacy that bridged rigorous observation with empathy for the animals she studied; Whereas Jane Goodall's influence extended far beyond academia, she authored more than 27 books for both adults and children, appeared in numerous documentaries and films, and became a cultural figure whose presence reached far outside scientific circles; Whereas, in 2019, the National Geographic Society honored her life's work with Becoming Jane, a traveling exhibit that continues to tour across the United States; Whereas her most recent book, ``The Book of Hope: A Survival Guide for Trying Times'', has been translated into more than 20 languages, ensuring her voice resonates with people around the globe; Whereas Jane Goodall's achievements have been recognized with some of the world's highest honors; Whereas Jane Goodall was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace in 2002, and 2 years later she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire at Buckingham Palace; Whereas Jane Goodall received the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom, the French Legion d'honneur, the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science, Japan's prestigious Kyoto Prize, the Gandhi-King Award for Nonviolence, the Medal of Tanzania, the Schweitzer Medal, and the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, countless other governments, institutions, and organizations have also celebrated her unique contributions; Whereas Jane Goodall recognized that protecting nature is first and foremost about educating and motivating human beings, on whom the survival of all species depends which became her life's mission, and she also never stopped advocating for the ethical treatment of animals; Whereas most of today's leading primatologists were either mentored by Jane Goodall or inspired by her life and work; Whereas, in 1991, Jane Goodall founded the Roots and Shoots Program, to bring together young people, from preschool through university, to learn about environmental challenges and to take action to address them; Whereas, today, Roots and Shoots has local chapters in some 75 countries, encompassing thousands of community-based groups and youth members worldwide; Whereas Jane Goodall recognized the critical role that Indigenous people have played throughout history as caretakers of the natural environment and stressed the need to include Indigenous people in decisions about policies, programs, and activities that impact their lands and livelihoods; Whereas Jane Goodall founded the TACARE program, recognizing that protecting forests and other natural resources is not possible if people living in the surrounding areas lack the necessities of life; Whereas TACARE supports community-led sustainable agriculture techniques, reforestation, public health, girls education, fuel efficient stoves, and small business development; Whereas Jane Goodall's life was a remarkable blend of science, advocacy, and compassion and she showed the world that understanding animals requires not only observation but empathy, that conservation demands both knowledge and courage, and that hope is a vital force in the struggle to protect the Earth; Whereas Jane Goodall's life was, above all, one of inspiration, she encouraged people everywhere, regardless of nationality, religion, or political affiliation, to recognize their ability and responsibility to protect wildlife and the planet's threatened ecosystems; Whereas whether through scientific discovery, writing, advocacy, or personal example, Jane Goodall conveyed an unshakable belief that individuals can make a difference; Whereas, on October 1, 2025, at the age of 91, Jane Goodall passed away while continuing the work to which she had devoted her life, raising awareness about threats to the global environment and urging humanity to act to protect it; Whereas her death marked the end of an extraordinary personal journey, but not of the movement she inspired; Whereas the programs Jane Goodall founded, the generations she mentored, and the many millions she influenced stand as enduring testaments to her vision and determination; and Whereas Jane Goodall's legacy will continue to inspire humanity to live in greater harmony with the natural world: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) pays tribute to Dr. Jane Goodall's lifelong dedication to the survival and ethical treatment of chimpanzees and other living things and to wildlife conservation throughout the world; (2) commends her tireless efforts to educate the public and especially children about the importance of protecting the natural environment; (3) extends its deepest condolences and sympathies to Jane Goodall's family and the staff at the Jane Goodall Institute and Roots and Shoots, in this time of loss; (4) recognizes the importance of Jane Goodall's advocacy for the ethical treatment of primates, including the Captive Primate Safety Act; and (5) honors the extraordinary life, leadership, and legacy of Jane Goodall, whose efforts to protect wildlife and the natural world continues to inspire people of every nationality on every continent. <all>",

RES. 463 Expressing condemnation of the Chinese Communist Party's persecution of religious minority groups, including Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists and the detention of Pastor ``Ezra'' Jin Mingri and leaders of the Zion Church, and reaffirming the United States' global commitment to promote religious freedom and tolerance. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES October 23, 2025 Mr. Cruz (for himself, Mr. Coons, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Grassley) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations _______________________________________________________________________ RESOLUTION Expressing condemnation of the Chinese Communist Party's persecution of religious minority groups, including Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists and the detention of Pastor ``Ezra'' Jin Mingri and leaders of the Zion Church, and reaffirming the United States' global commitment to promote religious freedom and tolerance. Whereas, on October 10, 2025, international news outlets reported that the Chinese Communist Party (referred to in this preamble as the ``CCP'') abducted Pastor ``Ezra'' Jin Mingri, who is the founder of Beijing Zion Church, from his home in Guangxi Province, China; Whereas CCP authorities also abducted more than 20 other pastors and church members from Zion Church; Whereas the CCP's actions mark the largest coordinated, nationwide crackdown against a Christian urban house church in more than 40 years; Whereas thousands of Zion Church members and millions of Christians and other religious adherents who reside in the People's Republic of China seek to peacefully worship God and care for their neighbors without the threat or fear of persecution; Whereas the imprisonment of Pastor Jin is the latest instance of CCP persecution of a large number of religious minorities, including Christians, Muslim Uyghurs, Hui Muslims, and Tibetan Buddhists; Whereas, in 2016, President Xi Jinping promised to ``Sinicize'' religion in China by allowing authorities to burn Bibles, imprison believers, and tear down Christian crosses, and by forcing religious organizations and adherents to conform to the ideology of the CCP; Whereas, in 2021, the Trump Administration determined the CCP had committed crimes against humanity and genocide against predominately Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang and that the CCP has continued to subject religious minorities to restrictions on religious practices and freedom of expression, arbitrary imprisonment, forced sterilization torture, and forced labor; Whereas the CCP has made consistent efforts to erode the religious, linguistic, and cultural identity of Tibetans, including by closing Buddhist monasteries and limiting entry or practitioners; Whereas Congress unanimously passed the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-292), which established, as the official policy of the United States-- (1) to condemn violations of religious freedom; (2) to promote, and assist other governments in the promotion of, the fundamental right to freedom of religion; (3) to stand for liberty and with the persecuted; (4) to use and implement appropriate tools in the United States foreign policy apparatus, including diplomatic, political, commercial, charitable, educational, and cultural channels; and (5) to promote respect for religious freedom by all governments and peoples; Whereas, under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has designated the People's Republic of China as a ``country of particular concern for religious freedom'' every year since 1999; Whereas Congress unanimously passed the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act (Public Law 114-281) in 2016 to enhance the capabilities of the United States to advance religious liberty globally through diplomacy, training, counterterrorism, and foreign assistance; Whereas the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114-328), enacted by Congress in 2016, gives the President the authority to impose targeted sanctions on individuals responsible for committing human rights violations; Whereas the People's Republic of China is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, done at Paris December 10, 1948, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, done at New York December 19, 1966, which recognize freedom of religion as a fundamental human right; Whereas Article 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China explicitly states that citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief; and Whereas the United States must show strong international leadership when it comes to the advancement of religious freedoms, liberties, and protections: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) strongly condemns the Chinese Communist Party's persecution of religious minorities, including Pastor ``Ezra'' Jin Mingri and other leaders and members of Zion Church and other faith communities; (2) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to promote religious freedom and tolerance around the world and to help provide protection and relief to religious minorities facing persecution and violence; (3) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of China to release the members of Zion Church, including Pastor Jin, and all other wrongfully detained religious leaders; and (4) demands that the Government of the People's Republic of China-- (A) respect the internationally recognized human right to freedom from religious persecution; and (B) end all forms of violence and discrimination against religious minorities and entities. <all>",

Whereas cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States; Whereas projected rates of cardiovascular disease are expected to increase significantly in the United States by 2060; Whereas, compared to urban areas, rural areas in the United States have higher death rates for cardiovascular disease and stroke, and a 40 percent higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease; Whereas risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disease and poor health outcomes include elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (referred to in this preamble as ``LDL-C''), high levels of lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, hypertension, obesity, low awareness of personal risk factors, genetics, geographic location, and inequitable access to care; Whereas lipoprotein(a) cholesterol is predominantly genetically inherited and can build up in the walls of blood vessels, creating cholesterol deposits, or plaques, and lead to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; Whereas LDL-C is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and having lower LDL-C is associated with a reduced risk of heart attack and stroke; Whereas more than 25.5 percent of adults in the United States have high LDL-C; Whereas more than 200 studies with more than 2,000,000 patients have broadly established that elevated LDL-C causes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; Whereas atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the build-up of cholesterol plaque within the walls of arteries and includes acute coronary syndrome, peripheral arterial disease, and events such as heart attacks and strokes; Whereas the resources needed to bend the curve on cardiovascular disease exist, yet 71 percent of hypercholesterolemia patients at high risk of a cardiovascular event never achieve recommended LDL-C treatment guideline thresholds; Whereas only 33 percent of individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who are taking statins, a guideline recommended lipid-lowering therapy, actually achieve LDL-C goals; Whereas, although clinical guidelines recommend that a patient hospitalized for heart attack receive an LDL-C test in the 90 days following discharge from a hospital, only 27 percent of patients receive the test; Whereas African-American adults are less likely to receive an LDL-C test in the 90 days following discharge from a hospital, despite having a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease; Whereas significant gaps in care may lead to subsequent cardiovascular events; Whereas the Million Hearts program seeks to improve access to and quality of care to reduce heart disease, stroke, and death; and Whereas September is recognized as National Cholesterol Education Month to raise awareness of cardiovascular disease and the importance of individuals knowing their LDL-C number: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) encourages all individuals in the United States to know their low density lipoprotein cholesterol (referred to in this resolution as ``LDL-C'') number; (2) designates September 2025 as ``National Cholesterol Education Month''; (3) designates September 30, 2025, as ``LDL-C Awareness Day''; and (4) recognizes the urgent need for screening and treating of elevated LDL-C to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and strokes. <all>",

Whereas each year more than 14,500 children under the age of 19 in the United States are diagnosed with cancer; Whereas every year approximately 1,600 children in the United States lose their lives to cancer; Whereas childhood cancer is one of the leading causes of death from disease after infancy and one of the leading causes of death overall for children in the United States; Whereas the 5-year survival rate for children with cancer in the United States has increased from 58 percent in the mid-1970s to 85 percent in 2025, representing a significant improvement from previous decades; Whereas 60 to more than 90 percent or more of children in the United States who survive cancer will develop at least one chronic health condition, and some survivors may face a late effect from treatment that can be severe or life-threatening; and Whereas childhood cancer occurs frequently and spares no racial or ethnic group, socioeconomic class, or geographic region: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) designates September 2025 as ``National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month''; (2) requests that the Federal Government, States, localities, and nonprofit organizations observe the month with appropriate programs and activities, with the goal of increasing public knowledge of the risks of childhood cancer; (3) encourages survivors of childhood cancer to continue to receive ongoing monitoring and care throughout their adult lives; (4) recognizes the human toll of childhood cancer and pledges to make the prevention of and cure for childhood cancer a public health priority; (5) reminds the people of the United States of the bravery of children who are diagnosed with cancer; and (6) commends and honors the courage of such children. <all>",
