No. Nonprofits, civic tech organizations, academic institutions, and government agencies can use CivicPulse under the AGPL-3.0 license free of charge.

### What if I want to contribute improvements back to CivicPulse?
Contributions are welcome! If you contribute code, you agree to license those contributions under both AGPL-3.0 (for the open source project) and grant us the right to relicense them commercially. This enables dual licensing to continue.
