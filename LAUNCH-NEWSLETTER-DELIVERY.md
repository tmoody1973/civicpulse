## Specific Content Highlights

### Problem Statement (Unchanged but Reinforced)
"Congress doesn't work well for busy people. You hear about bills on the news. Your representative votes on something important. A news headline says 'healthcare bill advanced' but you have no idea what it actually does. And if you wanted to read the full text? Congratulations, you're now reading 40+ pages of legal jargon. This is broken."

### Solution Positioning (Enhanced)
"Civic Pulse makes Congress as searchable as Google, as understandable as a news article, and as trackable as Twitter. You get the information you need, in the format you prefer, without being an expert."

### Technical Credibility (New)
"Built on Raindrop Platform during Liquid Metal Hackathon... SmartSQL, SmartBuckets semantic search, SmartMemory learns your preferences... Congress.gov integration pulling real-time data... The Hill RSS for breaking news... Claude Sonnet 4 for summaries... ElevenLabs text-to-dialogue for audio... Netlify deployment, Vultr storage."

### Call-to-Action (Unchanged)
"Start Free - No Credit Card" (consistent, low-friction, proven)
