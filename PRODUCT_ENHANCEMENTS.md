## VISION & GOALS

### The Go-To Source Strategy

**Mission:** Become the definitive platform for understanding U.S. legislation across all user segments.

**Success Metrics:**
- **Students:** 100,000+ using for research papers and civic education
- **Engaged Citizens:** 500,000+ tracking bills and taking action
- **Journalists:** 10,000+ using for fact-checking and research
- **Market Position:** Top 3 civic tech platforms by 2026

### User Segment Needs Analysis

| User Segment | Primary Needs | Pain Points | Opportunities |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Students** | Simplified explanations, citations, research tools | Bills are too complex, hard to cite, need historical context | Educational digests, citation tools, study guides |
| **Engaged Citizens** | Stay informed, take action, understand impact | Information overload, don't know where to start | Personalized alerts, action tracking, local impact |
| **Journalists** | Fast research, fact-checking, expert quotes | Time pressure, need credible sources, data viz | Press tools, quote extraction, timeline builders |

## AI-POWERED FEATURES

### 1. "Talk to a Bill" - Interactive Voice Agent üéôÔ∏è

**Concept:** Conversational AI that lets users ask questions about any bill using natural language.

**Technology Stack:**
- **ElevenLabs:** Voice synthesis and recognition
- **Claude Sonnet 4:** Natural language understanding and response generation
- **Raindrop SmartBuckets:** RAG for bill text retrieval

**User Experience:**

```typescript
// Example interaction flow
User: "Hey Civic Pulse, tell me about the healthcare bill HR 1234"
AI: "HR 1234, the Healthcare Access Act, was introduced by Rep. Nancy Pelosi.
     It aims to expand Medicare eligibility to include adults aged 50-64.
     What would you like to know more about?"

User: "How does it affect me if I'm 52 years old?"
AI: "Great question! If you're 52, you would become eligible for Medicare under
     this bill, which currently only covers those 65 and older. This could save
     you an estimated $800 per month on health insurance premiums."

User: "What are the chances it passes?"
AI: "Based on current co-sponsor counts and historical data, this bill has a
     35% chance of passing the House and 20% chance of becoming law. It has
     bipartisan support with 45 co-sponsors from both parties."
```

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// app/api/voice-chat/route.ts

import { ElevenLabs } from 'elevenlabs';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabs({
  apiKey: process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 27, 2025

House Passes Healthcare Expansion Bill in Bipartisan Vote

WASHINGTON - The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1234, the Healthcare
Access Act, by a vote of 285-150 Thursday evening, marking a significant
bipartisan achievement in healthcare policy.

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), would expand Medicare
eligibility to Americans aged 50-64, an estimated 15 million people. The
legislation received support from 45 Republicans, signaling broad consensus
on healthcare access issues.

"This is a victory for working families across America," Pelosi said during
floor debate. "No one should have to choose between paying rent and seeing
a doctor."

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the program would cost $450 billion
over 10 years but would reduce emergency room visits and long-term healthcare
costs.

The bill now moves to the Senate, where Majority Leader [Name] has indicated
it will receive a committee hearing within 30 days.

**Recommendation Algorithm:**
```typescript
// lib/recommendations/engine.ts

interface RecommendationEngine {
  // Based on user's tracked bills
  similarBills(userId: string): Promise<Bill[]>;

  // Based on user's interests
  topicalMatches(userId: string): Promise<Bill[]>;

  // Based on user's representatives
  localRelevance(userId: string): Promise<Bill[]>;

  // Trending among similar users
  collaborativeFiltering(userId: string): Promise<Bill[]>;

  // Breaking news and urgent votes
  timeSensitive(): Promise<Bill[]>;
}

export async function getRecommendations(userId: string): Promise<Bill[]> {
  const user = await getUser(userId);

  // Get recommendations from multiple sources
  const [similar, topical, local, trending, urgent] = await Promise.all([
    similarBills(userId),
    topicalMatches(userId),
    localRelevance(userId),
    collaborativeFiltering(userId),
    timeSensitive()
  ]);

  // Combine and rank using AI
  const combined = [...similar, ...topical, ...local, ...trending, ...urgent];
  const ranked = await rankRecommendations(combined, user.preferences);

  return ranked.slice(0, 20);
}
```

**UI:**
```tsx
// components/recommendations.tsx

export function BillRecommendations() {
  const recommendations = useRecommendations();

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Recommended for You</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>Based on your interests and activity</CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          {recommendations.map(rec => (
            <div key={rec.bill.id} className="flex gap-4 items-start">
              <div className="flex-1">
                <h4 className="font-medium">{rec.bill.title}</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1">
                  {rec.reason}
                </p>
                <div className="flex gap-2 mt-2">
                  {rec.bill.issue_categories.map(cat => (
                    <Badge key={cat} variant="secondary">{cat}</Badge>
                  ))}
                </div>
              </div>
              <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
                <Button size="sm">Track</Button>
                <Button size="sm" variant="ghost">Dismiss</Button>
              </div>
            </div>
